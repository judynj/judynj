    <title>Activities in IYPT</title>
    <url>/2020/09/28/Activities-in-IYPT/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p> I have been in a club about physics called IYPT since the new semester started. The project our group focus on is about hand helicopter,which is a big challenge for us.</p>
<p>  刚入学就参加了叫作IYPT的物理社团。我们小组研究的主题是竹蜻蜓（手提直升机），对于我们来说是一个巨大的挑战。</p>
<p> *<strong>The theme is like this: a simple hand helicopter can be made by attaching rotor blades to one end of a vertical stick. The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is twisted at a high enough speed and let go. Investigate how the relevant parameters affect the lift-off and the maximum height.**</strong></p>
<p><em>题目是这样的：一架简单的手提直升机可以通过将旋翼叶片固定在垂直杆的一端制作而成。当垂直杆以足够高的速度旋转时，松开手，手提直升机就会起飞。探究相关参数对起飞和飞行最大高度的影响。</em></p>
<p> All of our group member feel confused about the project when we first read it .The area it is involved is far beyond our level. we made a plan of clear division of work,then discussed the type of hand helicopter we should buy on the Internet. Later we searched essays in both Chinese and English ,most of them are written by college students,then learn the professional formula and words by ourselves. These work was all done in after-class time. Then in the club time of second week,we did a couple groups of contrastive experiment and got some useful data.</p>
<p>所有的组员都对这个课题感到无比困惑，因为它超出了我们的知识范围。很快我们做了详细的分工，然后讨论应该在网上买什么样类型的竹蜻蜓。然后我们又去搜索了大学生写的关于空气动力学的学术论文，并自学其中的专业公式和词汇。这些都是在课余时间做的事情。在第二次的社团课上，我们做了几组对比实验并得到了有用的数据。</p>
<p>These are the whole process since these two weeks. Although we did not do too much,but the confusion when first reading the theme is gone , and the experimental goal is more clearly .We all gain valuable experience –the awareness of the important of teamwork,for any wrong division of work will absolutely leads to failure.</p>
<p>这些是两周以来IYPT社团的进展。虽然工作量不是很大，但是看到课题时的一头雾水已经几乎消散，实验目标渐渐明晰。我们也从中得到了宝贵的经验——意识到了团队合作的重要，因为任何一个人工作量太大或者太小都会影响事情的成功与失败。</p>
<p>Hope my group will be success step by step.</p>
<p>希望我的小组一步步走向成功。</p>

    <title>British educational system</title>
    <url>/2020/11/23/British-educational-system/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I did a research about British educational system recently. Here is my mind map for the research.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DYWNLV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/23/DYWNLV.png" alt="DYWNLV.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is my research.</p>
<p>Britain has a long history of educating. Its education system has undergone hundreds of years of evolution, which is quite complete and complex, and has great flexibility. Generally speaking, It is divided into three stages :Compulsory Education, Further Education, and Higher Education. The differences between Chinese and British education systems make it impossible for students of the two countries to match each other in terms of age and academic level. Therefore, when considering studying in the UK, Chinese students must fully understand the differences between the two education systems and accurately determine where their level is in the UK education system. In order to choose appropriate courses and arrange reasonable study plan according to their own characteristics.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Compulsory Education**</strong></p>
<p>●The first stage is from 5-7 years old called the kindergarten education.</p>
<p>●The second stage is from 7-11 years old called primary education.</p>
<p>●The third stage is from 11-16 years old called secondary education.</p>
<p></u><u> </p>
<p>The period of compulsory education prescribed by law is between the ages of 5 and 16. School-age children must attend school, and the State is responsible for the necessary tuition fees, books and necessary supplies.</p>
<p>The GCSE is the diploma obtained after completing the last two years of Secondary Education. The number of Chinese students studying at GCSE is small, and is only suitable for students under 16.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong> </p>
<p>Grade A* (A good result of exceptional quality)</p>
<p>Grade A  (The higher grades needed for further and higher education)</p>
<p>Grade B</p>
<p>Grade C</p>
<p>Grade D  (Regarded as average grades-a good base from which to grow)</p>
<p>Grade E </p>
<p>Grade F  (The lower, but still useful,grades of achievement )</p>
<p>Grade G</p>
<p>Ungraded  (Unfortunately, no score )</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fourth stage (further education)**</strong></p>
<p>16-18 years old is a senior middle school or college preparatory class, which is the transition period from middle school to university, also known as continuing education stage, mainly includes academic direction and career direction study. Students who complete the preparatory courses mainly take the General Certificate of Education (Advanced Level).In addition to take the GCE-A level, vocational school students take the GNVQ (General National Vocational Qualification).</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Further education**</strong></p>
<p>Further education is the most exciting part of the UK education system. It is also a crucial stage for Chinese high school students to study in the UK. Students in further education generally fall between Grade 8 and Grade 9. It is divided into two systems: the academic route and the vocational route. Both systems are equally valued in Britain.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Academic route:(A*****</strong>*-level**<strong><strong><em>\</em>)\</strong></strong></p>
<p>The full name is General Certificate of Education Advanced Level, which is an important stage of the academic course. There are more than 100 subjects in it. We tend to think of A-level as the basic course of university. Generally subjects are selected according to two principles, which are known as professional objective principle and proficiency principle.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>professional objective principle**</strong></p>
<p>The three or four A-level subjects should be chosen around the major that the student wishes to study at undergraduate Level and his/her future career goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>proficiency principle**</strong></p>
<p>A-level grades also determine where student gets into university, so make sure you take one or two subjects that you are good at.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>vocational route**</strong></p>
<p>GNVQ is similar to the GCSE and A-level in the academic route. Students can arrange courses according to their own needs and interest,and can even work in the process of learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>The elective system**</strong></p>
<p>The elective system is simple and is divided into three parts,the Foundation, the Intermidiate(is similar as 4 sessions in GCSE and generally takes one year to complete), the Advanced(is equal to 2 A-levels and generally takes two years t complete)</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong></p>
<p>Distinction =A/B</p>
<p>Merit=C</p>
<p>Pass=D/E</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fifth stage**</strong> </p>
<p>It is called the college education, generally from the age of 18. It takes 3-4 years (medical for 5 years)for undergraduate study to obtain a bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree usually lasts 1-2 years,and a doctor’s degree usually lasts 3-5 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>A bachelor’s degree**</strong> </p>
<p>Bachelor Degree includes BA-Bachelor of Art，BSc-Bachelor of Science，BEng-Bachelor of Engineering,LLB</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>University of joint school**</strong></p>
<p>It is similar to the situation in China where many universities have secondary schools attached to them. Joint schools are generally close in geographical location,usually located in the same city. The purpose of establishing joint schools is to complement each other in teaching facilities and curriculum arrangement.</p>

    <title>a ppt about video digitizer</title>
    <url>/2020/10/11/a-ppt-about-video-digitizer/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="A-ppt-about-video-digitizer"><a href="#A-ppt-about-video-digitizer" class="headerlink" title="A ppt about video digitizer"></a>A ppt about video digitizer</h1><p>A few days ago ,my Computer Science teacher asked us to finish a ppt with a certain topic. My topic is about video digitizer,which is really a difficult topic for me because I knew nothing about this input device,and I couldn’t even find out its chinese meaning on the Internet!</p>
<p>So I asked my teacher for help,wanting to find what kind of device it is. He explained,but I still felt confused,so he advised me to search on Google. I thought that maybe a good idea to read its professional explanation directly instead of reading in Chinese,but later I found it difficult to enter the page because it belonged to the other country.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about what to do next,my dad came to help me. He said his colleague was on business abroad. He could ask his colleague to enter the website,searched the information and transferred it to me. After a few hours,I got the website which my father’s colleague sent to me.</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps1.jpg" alt="img"><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps2.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
<p>With the information on the website,I finally understood what a video digitizer was,and completed the ppt about how it works,it’s definition,and the range of its price,as well.</p>
<p>I finally handed it in before the deadline,and introduced this kind of input device in class successfully .</p>
<p>After this experience,I learned to study by myself. It is also important to ask others to help when looking for specific information.</p>
<p>Anyway, learning by myself is really fun!</p>

    <title>activities before the sports meeting</title>
    <url>/2020/10/14/activities-before-the-sports-meeting/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have prepared for the coming sports meeting since the beginning of October. I have been busy during this period of time.</p>
<p>The first one is the preparation of the dance in opening ceremony. It was really hard work to find a nice and easy-learning dance,moreover,my team had five girls,and most of them have different opinions towards it. Some thought we should choose a nice but difficult-learning dance,while others thought a simple and easy-learning one maybe better. Finally the leader chose a good-looking jazz ,then we started to learn from video on the internet,and we even hired a dancing room during the National holiday. But after a few days’ training,when it was twenty minutes before the expiration time of the dancing room ,we realized that the dance was too hard for us to learn,and the cool and fantastic style may not be suitable for us. So we decided to change with a gentle and simple one,and practiced on every PE lesson. Right till now,the process is successful as we thought.</p>
<p>Th second one is writing a profile about our group flag for the host to read .The hard point is that our group is made up of two classes ,since we international department has to be combined together as the headmaster asked. Therefor I have to mix two profiles into one and add introductions about our dance in it. That is really a great but difficult work. The deadline is closer and closer,and I am still working on it.</p>
<p>Here is my feeling about this activities.</p>
<p>Let me tell about the first activity. The result is quite good,but we still wasted our time even though correcting our mistakes promptly. However,the experience we can get is rich,as we know the decision which made first is important,if it goes wrong,that is a waste of time. So making a plan before action is the first step towards success.</p>
<p>The second thing I learn is time management. This quality is used frequently in my normal school life. Make a list of all the things I need to do, that may help or I will be busy working or staying up late before any deadline.</p>
<p>Hope I can be better step by step.</p>

    <title>activities in Mock Trial</title>
    <url>/2020/10/20/activities-in-Mock-Trial/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently I spent a lot of time on writing DX（known as direct examinations) for one of my clubs called Mock Trial. We will have a competition with students in Nanjing Foreign Language School.</p>
<p>The process writing DX is really exciting .We got a case summary about a girl named Jordan,who was good at running  but died because of hooking EPO under too much pressure. After her death,her parents charged a crime upon Coach Swift,who was major suspect that caused her death. Our duty was acted as different roles in these case and debated to find who was the actual murder.</p>
<p>I chose to act as Jordon’s friend,Morgan Pearce,a girl that knew the whole process. My partner I wrote DX with is my classmate Estalla. She acted as my attorney.</p>
<p>At first both of us had no idea what a DX was,so we looked through the many models the got the point,and that took us much time. Then the next problem came. Both of us were too busy to write DX together in school. The problem was dealt with quickly after a short time conversation. We came up with an appointed time to make a call on the wechat,then completed the task as soon as possible. That very evening she went online on time.</p>
<p>Since the DX has a format as a key to a question,we decided to divide our work. Estalla and I first confirmed the questions she would ask through the phone call,then she typed her them on WPS,at the same time I sent her my answer to the questions on the wechat for her to copy. The method was efficiency,and we done most of the work in one and a half hours.</p>
<p>The process of our work is like this.</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7Z7D"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7Z7D.jpg" alt="Bp7Z7D.jpg"></a></p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7WC9"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7WC9.jpg" alt="Bp7WC9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here is my feeling after finishing the task:</p>
<p>It is really my pleasure to cooperate with such a good girl. Estalla is one of the most excellent students I have ever seen before. She is easy and friendly to communicate with,and she is willing to finish the DX efficiently and perfectly as I thought we should. During our cooperating,both she and I was happy to accept suggestions from each other. This is not my first time cooperating with Estalla,and I hope that we could be partner again some day.</p>
<p>Anyway,choosing a good partner before starting a project is really important!</p>

    <title>feeling about a speech</title>
    <url>/2020/12/12/feeling-about-a-speech/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After watching Obama’s speech about education, I have a lot to say.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world takes responsibility, and for us students the responsibility is focusing on education. Taking responsibility to learn improves the way we live and is the basics for one’s life. </p>
<p>For every student, It is meaningful to set a goal and work hard on it instead of wasting time on chatting online or watching TV program. Moreover, poverty and difficulties in daily life are not excuse for not studying hard. Obama said that he was raised by his single mom, and his family was too poor to pay for the school. Every morning he got up early and did the work her mom gave him. He knew how important people should accept education from a young age, and that is why he stood there, giving speech about education, as the president of USA.</p>
<p>However, there must be failure before the final success. In this process, keeping on ask questions and asking for others help are necessary steps. Learning to admit that there is still a lot of things I do not know and that will make me learn something new as long as I have the curiosity in my field. </p>
<p>I study in one of the best international departments in Nanjing. I have financial support from my parents and some of best resources about academic education. Definitely all of us will get into top universities abroad, studying with the most excellent students from all over the world. Our conditions are better than before. We are at the most suitable age to learn, to compete with students abroad, and to prepare to make contribution for our country in the future.</p>

    <title>hornbill</title>
    <url>/2020/12/09/hornbill/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The hornbill is a peculiar and rare bird. The hornbill has a large head, a narrow neck, broad wings and a long tail. Their feathers are brown or black, usually with vivid white markings.  Their body length is about 70-120 cm, their mouth is as long as 35 cm, and a pair of big eyes with long thick eyelashes, which is rare among other birds. Its mouth is hollow, which makes it lighter but strong.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rPGJUS"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/09/rPGJUS.jpg" alt="rPGJUS.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Most of them live in the rain forests of Africa and Asia, and use holes which are picked out by woodpeckers as nests They often feed on fruit and insects for food. Every spring , hornbill in pairs choose caves in tall tree trunks. Generally, each lays one to four eggs at a time. The general life expectancy is about 30-40 years old, The longest can reach 50 years old.</p>
<p>There are 45 species of hornbill worldwide. Most of China’s live in western and southern Yunnan and southern Guangxi. In Xishuangbanna, China, there is a rhinoceros hornbill, which has been listed as a second-class national protected animal.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rPGU3j"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/09/rPGU3j.jpg" alt="rPGU3j.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The hornbills are closely related to humans. Nowadays, they are loved by Sarawak people. They are regarded as sacred birds by local people. They are also regarded as a god by the Iban people of Malaysia, who celebrate Hornbill Festival every year. </p>

    <title>good result</title>
    <url>/2020/12/01/good-result/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Our school organized a competition called UKMT recently. The process of preparation was hard, but I got a good result finally.</p>
<p>To prepare it, I downloaded several papers used before for practicing. Each test paper has twenty five questions in total, and after doing a few papers, I found it easy to do the first sixteen questions, and the question became harder when it came to next nine. So during the preparation, I draw a conclusion that I needed to spend more time on final nine to ten questions instead of checking the first fifteen to sixteen ones over and over again.</p>
<p>The other difficulty was equipment. Because of the corona virus, this was the first year that we did the competition online. As a result, the speed of WiFi really influenced the efficiency I answered the question. The blank page always lasted for a long time after finishing one question. After the competition, I asked several of my classmates. It was weird that some said the speed of WiFi was fast while some said not. That makes the competition a little unfair.</p>
<p>However,  I was satisfied with the result. The difficulty of equipment didn’t matter if one has strong strength.</p>

    <title>joining the Student Union</title>
    <url>/2020/11/12/joining-the-Student-Union/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week,I heard that the Student Union was looking for new members. After hearing the news, I enrolled immediately.</p>
<p>The interview came on Tuesday noon. I was really nervous when entering the room, then I stood on platform,while there was eight to nine students in front of me ,including the chairman and two vice-chairmen,and four ministers of four departments,which are known as activity department, IT department, financial department and academic department.</p>
<p>I introduced myself and told them that my experience was rich enough to be a member of activity department, because I was student in charge of propaganda work, and the work I did was associated with this department, such as decorating board and class cultural board , buying props that was needed in the sport meeting. They asked me what work could I take on if I was chosen, and I answered that I could organize some activities,since I did them so well before.</p>
<p>Soon I was informed that I was chosen in the afternoon, the ministers gave me congratulation,but at the same time she said I could talk more next time.</p>
<p>The advice made me think a lot. I am not a person that like talking much since I was very young. I was the student that spending the least time interviewed by those people because of the short speech. The phenomenon shows that I need a longer time to react after getting the question, as a result, I do not have many things to say. After thinking about it , I realize maybe the experience I have is not rich enough for me to come up with an example immediately when interviewed. However, that could be improved as time goes by.</p>

    <title>koala bear</title>
    <url>/2020/12/07/koala-bear/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Koala bear is Australia’s unique rare original animals. In 1788, John Price became the first European to document the animal after Europeans first landed on the Australian continent. Koalas soon got their first scientific name Phascolarctos Cinereus in 1816. Their English name comes from an English word meaning “no water”, because they get 90 percent of the water from the eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Koalas are fat, and their hair was thick. The length of an adult koala is about 70-80 cm, and the weight is about 10 kilograms. Their noses are big and round. Their forelimbs have very strong claws, which help them climb well. The male koalas weigh 50 percent more than the female, having a relatively broad face and small ears. The baby koala is only 2 cm long and weighs 6 grams. They must remain in their mother’s pouch for six months before they are fully developed.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DzQioq"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/07/DzQioq.jpg" alt="DzQioq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Koalas spend most of the time in trees and almost all of their life in eucalyptus trees. They sleep most of the day and the rest is spent sitting. They almost never drink water , and they feed on eucalyptus leaves, which they eat a lot and digest well. An adult koala eats about 500 grams of fresh leaves a day. Although there are more than 600 kinds of eucalyptus to choose from, koalas just feed on 30 of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DzQyp8"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/07/DzQyp8.jpg" alt="DzQyp8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Nowadays, human activities, forest fires and climate change are the main threats to koala. As a result of the loss of habitat, the difficulty of restoring burned forests, climate change and the disease, the population of Koala in Australia has declined significantly. They are included in IUCN Red List of Endangers Species.</p>

    <title>making poster and notice for the flea market</title>
    <url>/2020/11/25/making-poster-and-notice-for-the-flea-market/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Student Union plans to organize the flea market. As a member of activity department, I took on the responsibility to make the poster for the flea market.</p>
<p>Since I have never made one myself before, I found information online to choose an app that most people recommend for making the poster, then I found one called canva, and that helps a lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9QfO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9QfO.jpg" alt="Dd9QfO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The poster and the notice should include all the details of the flea market. The details were from the PPT that the other member did, so my work was copying the details and arranged them in a more attractive way. The task sounds pretty simple, but actually it took me a lot of time. </p>
<p>For the poster, it needs to be attractive, succinct and clear, but I mixed the concept with that of a notice’s totally, that made the poster a complex one. Luckily I were aware of my mistake, then corrected it in time. The poster was soon complicated and passed the audit of the minister of activity department.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9sXj"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9sXj.jpg" alt="Dd9sXj.jpg"></a></p>
<p>A big problem came when I was making the notice. The app I chose couldn’t support to design a form. Additionally, the form was needed to include all the items that students could take to school. So I asked my minister for help. She was very enthusiastic to help me and made a form with  transparent background in the form of a picture, then I managed to uploaded it on the notice.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9WNV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9WNV.jpg" alt="Dd9WNV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I finished the poster and the notice before the deadline, and the minister praised me for my high efficiency. From this event, I found how greatly a right tool or app and help from others influence the result. I won the praise and trust from the minister, that is a good beginning for organizing activities in Student Union.</p>

    <title>the feeling after attending FBLA</title>
    <url>/2020/10/06/the-feeling-after-attending-FBLA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​                                                      The feeling after attending FBLA</p>
<p>​                                                              参加FBLA社团的感想</p>
<p>Recently,I have been a member of a club  set in our school called FBLA. Our first task is setting a virtual company to provide goods for the coming Food Festival in January next year.</p>
<p>入学后我加入了一个叫作FBLA的社团.我们小组的第一个任务是创建一个虚拟的公司为明年一月份的校园美食节做准备.</p>
<p>The activity sounds great ,but we actually meet a lot of problems. Our group has six girls,but at first when we discussed the name of the group on wechat ,I found some of girls were too shy to come up with ideas,so they kept silence. Our group leader felt annoyed about it,so she sent some words in the wechat group,mainly to encourage the teammates to be more active and tell us their thoughts. That really worked. The goods we would produce were soon decided,so did Plan ABC. Yesterday a questionnaire about the advice the students in our school would like to give us was also done. Anyway ,the work we do together is more and more efficient.</p>
<p>这个活动听上去非常有意思，但实际上我们遇到了很多问题。我们小组的组员是六个女孩，但我发现一开始谈论小组名称的时候，一些女孩因为含羞从不提出建议。组长有点恼火，然后在微信群里发了些消息，大概意思就是想让组员们畅所欲言。这方法奏效了。我们小组很快确定了商品并制作了方案ABC。就在昨天，为了调查全校同学对方案的建议，一份电子版调查问卷新鲜出炉。我们越来越高效了。</p>
<p>Here is the feeling about the teamwork.</p>
<p>以下是我对这次活动的初步感受。</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be active and always share thoughts when solving problems in a group,or the efficiency would be particularly low when all the teammates keep silence.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>在集体活动中保持活跃，保持沉默只会让工作变得低效。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be organized and divide the duty to each of the members. If several people deal with one together,that maybe a waste of time because everyone has a different idea,and the problem cannot be solved in a short period of time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>分配任务可以让工作变得更有条理。如果一群人做同一个任务，人多口杂必然会浪费时间。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be manful as our group leader did. Because she pointed out of other’s mistakes, they can be corrected as soon as possible ,and then avoid the waste of more time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>要学习组长的果断。她及时指出了组员的错误并让她们立刻改正，这样很好地避免了浪费更多的时间</em></p>
<p>Hope we can finish the task successfully in the next four months!</p>
<p>希望我们可以一起在接下来的四个月里顺利完成任务！</p>

    <title>transport presentation</title>
    <url>/2020/12/15/transport-presentation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We were given a task about transportation taken by teachers and students in Jinling High School. We needed to make a survey, collected data and made a presentation about it.</p>
<p>We first had a meeting discussing about what question should be included in the survey. We spent about one hour designing the questionnaire and finally found seventeen questions that maybe useful to analysis data. We also made an electronic version one online, then uploaded it and asked our classmates to help us finish one.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMTcaq"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMTcaq.jpg" alt="rMTcaq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then we collected the data, and for every questions, we made a diagram analyzing how many percentages it took up. So that the difference could be easily recognized. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rM7WTI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rM7WTI.jpg" alt="rM7WTI.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHm9K"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHm9K.jpg" alt="rMHm9K.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMH8AI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMH8AI.jpg" alt="rMH8AI.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHJ4P"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHJ4P.jpg" alt="rMHJ4P.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After finishing analyzing, we started to make PPT. We chose several groups of data that were worth sharing, then searched information to support our guess to the data or give reasons. For example, to support the fact that most people thought too much private cars led to the urban congestion, I found out the accurate data. That was by the end of 2019, there were 2702000 cars in Nanjing, which was the seventeenth biggest all over the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHrEn"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHrEn.jpg" alt="rMHrEn.jpg"></a></p>
<p>During the process of making the PPT, every teammate coordinated well and finished their work before the deadline. Nobody complained about the great deal of work, and some boys that were good at making diagrams and PPT were very willing to help. I felt comfortable and satisfied working with these friends, and I hope that we can be teammates next time and do presentation together.</p>

    <title>writing a meeting memo</title>
    <url>/2020/11/17/writing-a-meeting-memo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We were asked to make a PPT to introduce British a few weeks ago. The task was having a meeting first, then writing a meeting memo before the PPT was done.</p>
<p>As the team leader, I took the responsibility to make a plan for the process. I first planned the deadline and sent it to our QQ group. The plan included everything we needed to do before the deadline.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DeCeYQ"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/17/DeCeYQ.jpg" alt="DeCeYQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In the 13th of November, we had a meeting in the hall of the international department in JinLing High School, the meeting went successfully and efficiently as we decided every part well. The PPT includes fourteen parts ,which is the name of the country, environment, climate ,natural resources, population, the symbol, administrative area, traveling, diet, history, education system, economic, transport, culture. We divided these topics into several parts, and allocated them according to their difficulty.</p>
<p>The meeting memo was done soon.</p>
<p>I learned a lot according to this opportunity to be the team leader. A team leader must plan things well, and chose the group member wisely. I knew them well and I am familiar with their qualities,then we cooperated well with each other. That leads to the success of writing the meeting memo.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/De9oW9"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/17/De9oW9.jpg" alt="De9oW9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I am sure that we can deal with the rest process together perfectly.</p>

    <title>continuing our experiment in IYPT</title>
    <url>/2020/11/04/continuing-our-experiment-in-IYPT/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We made a lot of conversations after getting the hard topic. Finally our team gave up the experimental variable value that was talked about before because the information related to this was too hard for us to understand. Finally ,we started our experiment about the relationship between the rotate speed and the height it reached .</p>
<p>Then here came a question about the facility,the equipment we found on taobao turned out to be useless. Therefore we made one by ourselves,and the material came from daily life,for example,the engine came from an electric fan. After comparing many ways,we decided to fix the hand helicopter on the engine by hot melt glue gun. The process was amazing ,and that was my first time using such a machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bg4Jf0"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/04/Bg4Jf0.jpg" alt="Bg4Jf0.jpg"></a></p>

<p>There came another question: How can we count the times when it was rotating and how to measure the height?Our tutor recommended an app ,but it was complex to use. At the end of the club,we used the  photo function of iPhone to slow down the speed and saw whether it worked well. It came out that the result was amazing，and the times it rotated could be counted clearly.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bg4h0H"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/04/Bg4h0H.jpg" alt="Bg4h0H.jpg"></a></p>
<p>From this experience,I learned a lot about how to choose a proper app to help analyze the data and how to use a machine that I had never used before. The two hours flew away quickly. In the end ,we not only recorded the experimental data,but also gained happiness and friendship between each other.</p>

    <title>the sports I do recently</title>
    <url>/2020/10/30/the-sports-I-do-recently/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After entering senior high, I moved to the house that has a skating rink nearby. Then I started to learn to skate.</p>
<p>However it turns out to be difficult. After several sessions, I found it easy to keep balance on ice ,but it was hard to skate graceful or as pretty as my coach did. In addition,sometimes I couldn’t match up my waist with legs, so the center of gravity changed a lot during coasting.</p>
<p>Luckily,my coach was pretty patient with me. He taught one method and told me about the tips over and over again,then encouraged me to practice imitating him. At present,I have already done some simple action successfully. This gives me courage to continuing skating and learning more. Practice makes perfect!</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNa0u8"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNa0u8.jpg" alt="BNa0u8.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNasEQ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNasEQ.jpg" alt="BNasEQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I made friend with a girl that graduated from the same senior high as mine,and she is now a student of an university in Canada. She was active and liked doing sports. She even set up a club called orienting when she was in high school and became the first proprietor. Because of the outbreak of corona virus,she stayed in Nanjing and worked as a dive coach. I knew her occasionally and soon became her student. She gave me advice on diving and encouraged me to pass a test to get a certification called Level 1,and that started my journey on diving.</p>
<p>Diving is a extreme sport so they are many things I should learn,like the equipment,the safety tips after getting deep in the sea.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures when I first learned how to dive into the water., the first step is great,and there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNdHeS"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNdHeS.jpg" alt="BNdHeS.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Besides these,I will start to join aerobics next week,and learn to play table tennis by myself with my classmates. Those kinds of sports make my spare time colorful.</p>

    <title>lemur</title>
    <url>/2020/12/02/lemur/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>About 1,600,000 years ago, Madagascar was a part of African continent. As time flew, Madagascar left Africa. According to the record of fossil, the first lemur-like animal appeared on the African continent 600,000 years ago before entering Madagascar.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKZWT"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKZWT.jpg" alt="DoKZWT.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKlwR"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKlwR.jpg" alt="DoKlwR.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There are twenty types of lemurs on Madagascar island, and because of the difference of environment and climate, their characteristics are different. They are generally small, with a dog-like face and move like monkeys. Their fur is brown and gray. Most of the time, they are gentle, careful and have a specially long tail.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKzA1"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKzA1.jpg" alt="DoKzA1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMicD"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMicD.jpg" alt="DoMicD.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMK9f"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMK9f.jpg" alt="DoMK9f.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMljg"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMljg.jpg" alt="DoMljg.jpg"></a></p>
<p>They like enjoying the warmth of the sun, and it turns out that they are afraid of coldness. They depend on fruit on the island, and they care nothing but their families. When they jump from a tree to the ground in order to escape from enemies or find food or other reasons, it can be distinguished from normal monkeys, for they bend their back first then jump during movement.</p>
<p>Thanks to their isolated environment on Madagascar and islands nearby, they live without dangerous enemies. However, human deforestation is the leading cause of the lemur’s survival crisis, which has reduced the amount of space of them by 90 percent. Despite the terrible conditions, and important scientific value, Lexus still remain one of the least understood animals in the world.</p>
<p>Lemurs are listed on the IUCN Red List and the Washington convention CITES appendix I level to protect animals.</p>

    <title>Mock Trial</title>
    <url>/2020/12/19/Mock-Trial/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week our school played Mock Trial with Nanjing Foreign Language School A-level center. I tried my best in the activity, but the result was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The case was about the death of a girl. She played an important role in track and field team and  hooked on EPO to get award, but the pressure from daily life made her much too tired, then she died suddenly. Our team’s goal was to show judge the major responsibility of the girl’s coach. I acted as the witness, the girl’s best friend. The other two groups in our side acted as the girl’s mother and a specialist of steroid. Each witness had an attorney as their partner.</p>
<p>All the attorneys and witness had prepared the direct examination and cross examination for a few months, except the specialist and his attorney, who did not even know the whole chart of the competition. That made the process pretty hard when it was their turn to do direct examination and cross examination. The attorney couldn’t express his meaning clearly and didn’t know how to make an objection. At last, our score was twenty points lower than Nanjing Foreign Language School A-level Center.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think my performance was perfect, but the whole process depended on teamwork, that means anyone of us can’t be the one that encumber the group. Everyone should do their best, or the result is unfair who gets full preparation for it.</p>

    <title>math presentation</title>
    <url>/2020/12/19/math-presentation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my friend and I made a presentation about the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles. We divided our work as soon as we received the task. She would deal with the sum of the interior angles, and I would do the rest. I was asked to look for some exercise for our PPT.</p>
<p>Then we moved on. We searched a lot of information online, like how to prove the sum of the exterior angles for all polygons is 360. Then my friend sent me her part, and I combined it with mine. After that, I sent the PPT which was done then asked her to check whether there was some grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes in it. Before the day we did the presentation, I had a meeting with her to do a rehearsal together.</p>

<p>The presentation was successful since we were the only group that presented in English. Cooperating with that friend makes me feel extremely good, because she was hard-working and took the presentation seriously, and she never failed to send me files I asked before the deadline I gave her. Hope to work together with her next time.</p>

    <title>Pandora&#39;s box</title>
    <url>/2020/12/25/Pandora-s-box/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a poetry to memorize the unforgettable 2020.</p>
<p><u>Pandora’s box</p>
<p>2020 came on its cat feet</p>
<p>opening Pandora’s box secretly</p>
<p>disaster and pain flew out</p>
<p>making people suffer and scream </p>
<p>when the world was immersed in panic</p>
<p>a beam of light broke the dark</p>
<p>it lighted up the way and said</p>
<p>don’t worry</p>
<p>the hope is at the bottom of the box</u></p>
<p>After Prometheus stole the fire, Zeus severely punished him and turned his wrath on the mankind. He decided to create a new kind of disaster for them. Zeus ordered Herhuisto, the god of craftsmen, to make Pandora unique in the world and gave her a small delicate box a gift. Zeus let Hermes send her to earth and asked Erbimetus, brother of Prometheus, to marry her. One day after the wedding, Pandora opened the box because of curiosity, releasing hunger, disease, greed, jealousy, resentment, and the revenge throughout the land. </p>
<p>I soon came up with the story of Pandora’s box after knowing the theme of the competition was hope. In 2020, there was war, volcanic eruption in the Philippines, avalanche in Kashmir, locust plague in Africa, the collapse of Russia’s stadium, unknown disease in Nigeria, Brazil’s mysterious virus, breaking the Antarctic twenty degree… All this things were the disaster that was carelessly let out of. It made the death increase and mankind regard each other as an enemy. However what Zeus ignored was that the hope always came with disaster, and there will definitely be a day that the world is reborn.</p>

    <title>environmental problem</title>
    <url>/2021/01/02/environmental-problem/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I made a poster about global warming to call on people to pay attention to environmental problem. Most content were summarized from my chemistry book.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide enters the air through respiration and burning and it is removed by plants during photosynthesis. Burning more fuel and cutting down the forests increase the problem. Burning less fossil fuel and planting more trees would help to solve it. Methane is also another factor that cause global warming. it is produced by animals such as cows, and it is a by-product of digesting their food. It emerges from both ens of the cow. Intriguingly, termites are also significant contributors to the methane in the atmosphere. In addition, it is produced by the decay of food and other dead organic matter. It is produced in large quantities by rice paddy fields and landfill sites. Treating organic water so that the methane could be collected and burnt as fuel would help solve the problem.</p>
<p>The global warming may cause problems. Glaciers and polar ice will melt. This will cause a rice in sea level, and low-lying land will be flooded. The surface temperature of the earth will increase. Deserts will spread and millions of people will have less water. Severe weather events will increase in frequency, and hurricanes and flooding will become more common. In some areas it may become easier to grow food crops but in others it will certainly become more difficult.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/spCQgO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/02/spCQgO.jpg" alt="spCQgO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After making the poster, I got something that went beyond my book. When people focus on development in economic, they should not ignore the problem about problem of environment, this includes air pollution, water pollution, light pollution and so on, which really have a great influence on mankind.</p>

    <title>good results about FBLA</title>
    <url>/2021/01/09/good-results-about-FBLA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I joint a competition about economic and business plan. Before the examination, we were given a booklet covering all the points that would appear in the examination. Then after a month of self-study, the examination began in the evening of a weekday.</p>
<p>The content was complicated to me because I had never learned business plan before, and the points in the booklet were too much. However I memorized them as much as possible, and finally managed to remember most of the points in the booklet. I finished not only memorizing the points but also the example questions in the end of each chapter. During the process of the examination, I found that many of the questions were similar to the example questions on the booklet. That was really good luck.</p>
<p>The result came out a few days ago. For the economic. I got the qualification of being a candidate in the economic competition, and the qualification of advancing the final in business plan.</p>

<p>I hope that I could get good results in the final competition in Shanghai.</p>

    <title>giraffes</title>
    <url>/2021/01/21/giraffes/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Giraffes are the world’s tallest living land animals, standing up to 6 to 8 meters, weighing about 700 kilograms. Newborn cubs can be 1.5 meters tall.</p>
<p>Giraffes can’t live on grass, they can only live on leaves. Their tongue is long and can be used for feeding. They live in forests and were widely distributed in prehistoric times, even in China. They are found only in Africa, and there are two species remaining.</p>
<p>The long necks and long legs can help them get cool. They live in hot savanna, and due to their large surface, this is good for emission of heat. Their lung capacity is large, and this is good for taking fresh breath and scavenging. Because of their long legs, giraffes have difficulty in drinking water. Giraffes drink water by straddling their front legs or kneeling on the ground, and are easy to be attacked by other animals, so social giraffes tend not to drink together.</p>
<p>Giraffes don’t sleep too much, typically two hours a night, and sleep can sometimes put them at risk. Giraffes spend a full minute getting up from the ground, and this reduce their ability to escape during sleep.</p>
<p>Given that some giraffes are increasing, some are declining and some appear to be stable, the most useful and appropriate actions for giraffes will vary depending on ecological stability, national policies and legislation. In 2010, they were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>

    <title>Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo</title>
    <url>/2021/01/31/Nanjing-Hongshan-Forest-Zoo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When most of zoos in China had relatively primitive business models, Nanjing Hongshan Zoo cancelled animal performances and feeding. It began to pay attention to animal welfare and invested a lot of money in the improvement, protection and scientific research of animal living environment. However, due to the coronavirus, the income of the zoo declined greatly, leading to difficulties in the operation of the zoo. As a result of last year’s epidemic situation, the park lost more than $30 million in 220, and 40%of its revenue, ad lost more than 20 employees.</p>
<p>To deal with the situation, the Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo came up with an activity called adopting animals. It uploaded electronic animal adoption manual online, and called on people to choose animals. All they need to do is pay the fees for the animals they choose. They can get report of their animals twice a year, and have a close contact with their animals once a year. Everyone is excited and is willing to take part in such a interesting activity.</p>
<p>My class plan to adopt a panda, which is 3000 rmb every year, and I plan to adopt a leopard individually, which is 2000 rmb every year.</p>
<p>The activity is corresponded by many animal lovers, and I would like to be a volunteer in Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo. Hope the zoo can get through the crisis in the future.</p>

    <title>the proudest thing</title>
    <url>/2021/02/07/the-proudest-thing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I study in the A level center in the International department of Jinling High School. I am a hard-working girl and always manage to deal with problems well. I particularly do well in maths and chemistry, and I very much enjoy studying independently. When I meet any academic problems like difficult homework or content in the process of preview, I always try to solve the problem myself first of all, then ask classmates or teachers if I still don’t understand. I am also warm-hearted, because I adopted a kitten which was abandoned during the coronavirus outbreak. I am very energetic and usually spend about two to three hours doing sports every week. For instance, diving is my favorite, and I have always imagined going diving in the deep sea, exploring various creatures and observing unknown species. My friends always praise me for having a high efficiency when doing homework, and the ability to prepare for several competitions like UKMT, FBLA and AMC or activities at the same time and usually getting good results. Many of them like asking me questions about the content of the lecture after class, and I enjoy discussing their problems with them. We always work as a group to prepare lessons for the class, which makes me feel fulfilled and delighted.</p>
<p>The activity I am most proud of was joining an organization called MMUN ( Montessori Model United Nations ). My topic was about environmental problems in the Mediterranean and the impact refugees had on the environment. I spent about four months researching this, in particular, how the United Nations dealt with it, offering recommendations on how to improve the situation, writing my draft speech which had to be altered several times, and finally going to the General Headquarters of the United Nations in the USA. Over two days, my group discussed international politics with students of my age from all over the world. The greatest feelings came when everyone had their eyes focused on me as I was delivering my speech. Although I was feeling nervous, a friendly smile from the chairman removed my feeling of tension and anxiety when I stood on the platform, talking about my personal suggestions to resolve the problems in the Mediterranean. This activity was both exciting and challenging because I had the chance to debate topics in the adult world and let my voice be heard. </p>
