    <title>Activities in IYPT</title>
    <url>/2020/09/28/Activities-in-IYPT/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p> I have been in a club about physics called IYPT since the new semester started. The project our group focus on is about hand helicopter,which is a big challenge for us.</p>
<p>  刚入学就参加了叫作IYPT的物理社团。我们小组研究的主题是竹蜻蜓（手提直升机），对于我们来说是一个巨大的挑战。</p>
<p> *<strong>The theme is like this: a simple hand helicopter can be made by attaching rotor blades to one end of a vertical stick. The helicopter moves upwards when the stick is twisted at a high enough speed and let go. Investigate how the relevant parameters affect the lift-off and the maximum height.**</strong></p>
<p><em>题目是这样的：一架简单的手提直升机可以通过将旋翼叶片固定在垂直杆的一端制作而成。当垂直杆以足够高的速度旋转时，松开手，手提直升机就会起飞。探究相关参数对起飞和飞行最大高度的影响。</em></p>
<p> All of our group member feel confused about the project when we first read it .The area it is involved is far beyond our level. we made a plan of clear division of work,then discussed the type of hand helicopter we should buy on the Internet. Later we searched essays in both Chinese and English ,most of them are written by college students,then learn the professional formula and words by ourselves. These work was all done in after-class time. Then in the club time of second week,we did a couple groups of contrastive experiment and got some useful data.</p>
<p>所有的组员都对这个课题感到无比困惑，因为它超出了我们的知识范围。很快我们做了详细的分工，然后讨论应该在网上买什么样类型的竹蜻蜓。然后我们又去搜索了大学生写的关于空气动力学的学术论文，并自学其中的专业公式和词汇。这些都是在课余时间做的事情。在第二次的社团课上，我们做了几组对比实验并得到了有用的数据。</p>
<p>These are the whole process since these two weeks. Although we did not do too much,but the confusion when first reading the theme is gone , and the experimental goal is more clearly .We all gain valuable experience –the awareness of the important of teamwork,for any wrong division of work will absolutely leads to failure.</p>
<p>这些是两周以来IYPT社团的进展。虽然工作量不是很大，但是看到课题时的一头雾水已经几乎消散，实验目标渐渐明晰。我们也从中得到了宝贵的经验——意识到了团队合作的重要，因为任何一个人工作量太大或者太小都会影响事情的成功与失败。</p>
<p>Hope my group will be success step by step.</p>
<p>希望我的小组一步步走向成功。</p>

    <title>British educational system</title>
    <url>/2020/11/23/British-educational-system/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I did a research about British educational system recently. Here is my mind map for the research.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DYWNLV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/23/DYWNLV.png" alt="DYWNLV.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is my research.</p>
<p>Britain has a long history of educating. Its education system has undergone hundreds of years of evolution, which is quite complete and complex, and has great flexibility. Generally speaking, It is divided into three stages :Compulsory Education, Further Education, and Higher Education. The differences between Chinese and British education systems make it impossible for students of the two countries to match each other in terms of age and academic level. Therefore, when considering studying in the UK, Chinese students must fully understand the differences between the two education systems and accurately determine where their level is in the UK education system. In order to choose appropriate courses and arrange reasonable study plan according to their own characteristics.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Compulsory Education**</strong></p>
<p>●The first stage is from 5-7 years old called the kindergarten education.</p>
<p>●The second stage is from 7-11 years old called primary education.</p>
<p>●The third stage is from 11-16 years old called secondary education.</p>
<p></u><u> </p>
<p>The period of compulsory education prescribed by law is between the ages of 5 and 16. School-age children must attend school, and the State is responsible for the necessary tuition fees, books and necessary supplies.</p>
<p>The GCSE is the diploma obtained after completing the last two years of Secondary Education. The number of Chinese students studying at GCSE is small, and is only suitable for students under 16.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong> </p>
<p>Grade A* (A good result of exceptional quality)</p>
<p>Grade A  (The higher grades needed for further and higher education)</p>
<p>Grade B</p>
<p>Grade C</p>
<p>Grade D  (Regarded as average grades-a good base from which to grow)</p>
<p>Grade E </p>
<p>Grade F  (The lower, but still useful,grades of achievement )</p>
<p>Grade G</p>
<p>Ungraded  (Unfortunately, no score )</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fourth stage (further education)**</strong></p>
<p>16-18 years old is a senior middle school or college preparatory class, which is the transition period from middle school to university, also known as continuing education stage, mainly includes academic direction and career direction study. Students who complete the preparatory courses mainly take the General Certificate of Education (Advanced Level).In addition to take the GCE-A level, vocational school students take the GNVQ (General National Vocational Qualification).</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Further education**</strong></p>
<p>Further education is the most exciting part of the UK education system. It is also a crucial stage for Chinese high school students to study in the UK. Students in further education generally fall between Grade 8 and Grade 9. It is divided into two systems: the academic route and the vocational route. Both systems are equally valued in Britain.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Academic route:(A*****</strong>*-level**<strong><strong><em>\</em>)\</strong></strong></p>
<p>The full name is General Certificate of Education Advanced Level, which is an important stage of the academic course. There are more than 100 subjects in it. We tend to think of A-level as the basic course of university. Generally subjects are selected according to two principles, which are known as professional objective principle and proficiency principle.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>professional objective principle**</strong></p>
<p>The three or four A-level subjects should be chosen around the major that the student wishes to study at undergraduate Level and his/her future career goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>proficiency principle**</strong></p>
<p>A-level grades also determine where student gets into university, so make sure you take one or two subjects that you are good at.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>vocational route**</strong></p>
<p>GNVQ is similar to the GCSE and A-level in the academic route. Students can arrange courses according to their own needs and interest,and can even work in the process of learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>The elective system**</strong></p>
<p>The elective system is simple and is divided into three parts,the Foundation, the Intermidiate(is similar as 4 sessions in GCSE and generally takes one year to complete), the Advanced(is equal to 2 A-levels and generally takes two years t complete)</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong></p>
<p>Distinction =A/B</p>
<p>Merit=C</p>
<p>Pass=D/E</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fifth stage**</strong> </p>
<p>It is called the college education, generally from the age of 18. It takes 3-4 years (medical for 5 years)for undergraduate study to obtain a bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree usually lasts 1-2 years,and a doctor’s degree usually lasts 3-5 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>A bachelor’s degree**</strong> </p>
<p>Bachelor Degree includes BA-Bachelor of Art，BSc-Bachelor of Science，BEng-Bachelor of Engineering,LLB</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>University of joint school**</strong></p>
<p>It is similar to the situation in China where many universities have secondary schools attached to them. Joint schools are generally close in geographical location,usually located in the same city. The purpose of establishing joint schools is to complement each other in teaching facilities and curriculum arrangement.</p>

    <title>a ppt about video digitizer</title>
    <url>/2020/10/11/a-ppt-about-video-digitizer/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="A-ppt-about-video-digitizer"><a href="#A-ppt-about-video-digitizer" class="headerlink" title="A ppt about video digitizer"></a>A ppt about video digitizer</h1><p>A few days ago ,my Computer Science teacher asked us to finish a ppt with a certain topic. My topic is about video digitizer,which is really a difficult topic for me because I knew nothing about this input device,and I couldn’t even find out its chinese meaning on the Internet!</p>
<p>So I asked my teacher for help,wanting to find what kind of device it is. He explained,but I still felt confused,so he advised me to search on Google. I thought that maybe a good idea to read its professional explanation directly instead of reading in Chinese,but later I found it difficult to enter the page because it belonged to the other country.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about what to do next,my dad came to help me. He said his colleague was on business abroad. He could ask his colleague to enter the website,searched the information and transferred it to me. After a few hours,I got the website which my father’s colleague sent to me.</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps1.jpg" alt="img"><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps2.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
<p>With the information on the website,I finally understood what a video digitizer was,and completed the ppt about how it works,it’s definition,and the range of its price,as well.</p>
<p>I finally handed it in before the deadline,and introduced this kind of input device in class successfully .</p>
<p>After this experience,I learned to study by myself. It is also important to ask others to help when looking for specific information.</p>
<p>Anyway, learning by myself is really fun!</p>

    <title>activities before the sports meeting</title>
    <url>/2020/10/14/activities-before-the-sports-meeting/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have prepared for the coming sports meeting since the beginning of October. I have been busy during this period of time.</p>
<p>The first one is the preparation of the dance in opening ceremony. It was really hard work to find a nice and easy-learning dance,moreover,my team had five girls,and most of them have different opinions towards it. Some thought we should choose a nice but difficult-learning dance,while others thought a simple and easy-learning one maybe better. Finally the leader chose a good-looking jazz ,then we started to learn from video on the internet,and we even hired a dancing room during the National holiday. But after a few days’ training,when it was twenty minutes before the expiration time of the dancing room ,we realized that the dance was too hard for us to learn,and the cool and fantastic style may not be suitable for us. So we decided to change with a gentle and simple one,and practiced on every PE lesson. Right till now,the process is successful as we thought.</p>
<p>Th second one is writing a profile about our group flag for the host to read .The hard point is that our group is made up of two classes ,since we international department has to be combined together as the headmaster asked. Therefor I have to mix two profiles into one and add introductions about our dance in it. That is really a great but difficult work. The deadline is closer and closer,and I am still working on it.</p>
<p>Here is my feeling about this activities.</p>
<p>Let me tell about the first activity. The result is quite good,but we still wasted our time even though correcting our mistakes promptly. However,the experience we can get is rich,as we know the decision which made first is important,if it goes wrong,that is a waste of time. So making a plan before action is the first step towards success.</p>
<p>The second thing I learn is time management. This quality is used frequently in my normal school life. Make a list of all the things I need to do, that may help or I will be busy working or staying up late before any deadline.</p>
<p>Hope I can be better step by step.</p>

    <title>activities in Mock Trial</title>
    <url>/2020/10/20/activities-in-Mock-Trial/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Recently I spent a lot of time on writing DX（known as direct examinations) for one of my clubs called Mock Trial. We will have a competition with students in Nanjing Foreign Language School.</p>
<p>The process writing DX is really exciting .We got a case summary about a girl named Jordan,who was good at running  but died because of hooking EPO under too much pressure. After her death,her parents charged a crime upon Coach Swift,who was major suspect that caused her death. Our duty was acted as different roles in these case and debated to find who was the actual murder.</p>
<p>I chose to act as Jordon’s friend,Morgan Pearce,a girl that knew the whole process. My partner I wrote DX with is my classmate Estalla. She acted as my attorney.</p>
<p>At first both of us had no idea what a DX was,so we looked through the many models the got the point,and that took us much time. Then the next problem came. Both of us were too busy to write DX together in school. The problem was dealt with quickly after a short time conversation. We came up with an appointed time to make a call on the wechat,then completed the task as soon as possible. That very evening she went online on time.</p>
<p>Since the DX has a format as a key to a question,we decided to divide our work. Estalla and I first confirmed the questions she would ask through the phone call,then she typed her them on WPS,at the same time I sent her my answer to the questions on the wechat for her to copy. The method was efficiency,and we done most of the work in one and a half hours.</p>
<p>The process of our work is like this.</p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7Z7D"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7Z7D.jpg" alt="Bp7Z7D.jpg"></a></p>
<p> <a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7WC9"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7WC9.jpg" alt="Bp7WC9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here is my feeling after finishing the task:</p>
<p>It is really my pleasure to cooperate with such a good girl. Estalla is one of the most excellent students I have ever seen before. She is easy and friendly to communicate with,and she is willing to finish the DX efficiently and perfectly as I thought we should. During our cooperating,both she and I was happy to accept suggestions from each other. This is not my first time cooperating with Estalla,and I hope that we could be partner again some day.</p>
<p>Anyway,choosing a good partner before starting a project is really important!</p>

    <title>feeling about a speech</title>
    <url>/2020/12/12/feeling-about-a-speech/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After watching Obama’s speech about education, I have a lot to say.</p>
<p>Everyone in the world takes responsibility, and for us students the responsibility is focusing on education. Taking responsibility to learn improves the way we live and is the basics for one’s life. </p>
<p>For every student, It is meaningful to set a goal and work hard on it instead of wasting time on chatting online or watching TV program. Moreover, poverty and difficulties in daily life are not excuse for not studying hard. Obama said that he was raised by his single mom, and his family was too poor to pay for the school. Every morning he got up early and did the work her mom gave him. He knew how important people should accept education from a young age, and that is why he stood there, giving speech about education, as the president of USA.</p>
<p>However, there must be failure before the final success. In this process, keeping on ask questions and asking for others help are necessary steps. Learning to admit that there is still a lot of things I do not know and that will make me learn something new as long as I have the curiosity in my field. </p>
<p>I study in one of the best international departments in Nanjing. I have financial support from my parents and some of best resources about academic education. Definitely all of us will get into top universities abroad, studying with the most excellent students from all over the world. Our conditions are better than before. We are at the most suitable age to learn, to compete with students abroad, and to prepare to make contribution for our country in the future.</p>

    <title>hornbill</title>
    <url>/2020/12/09/hornbill/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The hornbill is a peculiar and rare bird. The hornbill has a large head, a narrow neck, broad wings and a long tail. Their feathers are brown or black, usually with vivid white markings.  Their body length is about 70-120 cm, their mouth is as long as 35 cm, and a pair of big eyes with long thick eyelashes, which is rare among other birds. Its mouth is hollow, which makes it lighter but strong.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rPGJUS"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/09/rPGJUS.jpg" alt="rPGJUS.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Most of them live in the rain forests of Africa and Asia, and use holes which are picked out by woodpeckers as nests They often feed on fruit and insects for food. Every spring , hornbill in pairs choose caves in tall tree trunks. Generally, each lays one to four eggs at a time. The general life expectancy is about 30-40 years old, The longest can reach 50 years old.</p>
<p>There are 45 species of hornbill worldwide. Most of China’s live in western and southern Yunnan and southern Guangxi. In Xishuangbanna, China, there is a rhinoceros hornbill, which has been listed as a second-class national protected animal.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rPGU3j"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/09/rPGU3j.jpg" alt="rPGU3j.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The hornbills are closely related to humans. Nowadays, they are loved by Sarawak people. They are regarded as sacred birds by local people. They are also regarded as a god by the Iban people of Malaysia, who celebrate Hornbill Festival every year. </p>

    <title>good result</title>
    <url>/2020/12/01/good-result/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Our school organized a competition called UKMT recently. The process of preparation was hard, but I got a good result finally.</p>
<p>To prepare it, I downloaded several papers used before for practicing. Each test paper has twenty five questions in total, and after doing a few papers, I found it easy to do the first sixteen questions, and the question became harder when it came to next nine. So during the preparation, I draw a conclusion that I needed to spend more time on final nine to ten questions instead of checking the first fifteen to sixteen ones over and over again.</p>
<p>The other difficulty was equipment. Because of the corona virus, this was the first year that we did the competition online. As a result, the speed of WiFi really influenced the efficiency I answered the question. The blank page always lasted for a long time after finishing one question. After the competition, I asked several of my classmates. It was weird that some said the speed of WiFi was fast while some said not. That makes the competition a little unfair.</p>
<p>However,  I was satisfied with the result. The difficulty of equipment didn’t matter if one has strong strength.</p>

    <title>joining the Student Union</title>
    <url>/2020/11/12/joining-the-Student-Union/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week,I heard that the Student Union was looking for new members. After hearing the news, I enrolled immediately.</p>
<p>The interview came on Tuesday noon. I was really nervous when entering the room, then I stood on platform,while there was eight to nine students in front of me ,including the chairman and two vice-chairmen,and four ministers of four departments,which are known as activity department, IT department, financial department and academic department.</p>
<p>I introduced myself and told them that my experience was rich enough to be a member of activity department, because I was student in charge of propaganda work, and the work I did was associated with this department, such as decorating board and class cultural board , buying props that was needed in the sport meeting. They asked me what work could I take on if I was chosen, and I answered that I could organize some activities,since I did them so well before.</p>
<p>Soon I was informed that I was chosen in the afternoon, the ministers gave me congratulation,but at the same time she said I could talk more next time.</p>
<p>The advice made me think a lot. I am not a person that like talking much since I was very young. I was the student that spending the least time interviewed by those people because of the short speech. The phenomenon shows that I need a longer time to react after getting the question, as a result, I do not have many things to say. After thinking about it , I realize maybe the experience I have is not rich enough for me to come up with an example immediately when interviewed. However, that could be improved as time goes by.</p>

    <title>koala bear</title>
    <url>/2020/12/07/koala-bear/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Koala bear is Australia’s unique rare original animals. In 1788, John Price became the first European to document the animal after Europeans first landed on the Australian continent. Koalas soon got their first scientific name Phascolarctos Cinereus in 1816. Their English name comes from an English word meaning “no water”, because they get 90 percent of the water from the eucalyptus.</p>
<p>Koalas are fat, and their hair was thick. The length of an adult koala is about 70-80 cm, and the weight is about 10 kilograms. Their noses are big and round. Their forelimbs have very strong claws, which help them climb well. The male koalas weigh 50 percent more than the female, having a relatively broad face and small ears. The baby koala is only 2 cm long and weighs 6 grams. They must remain in their mother’s pouch for six months before they are fully developed.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DzQioq"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/07/DzQioq.jpg" alt="DzQioq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Koalas spend most of the time in trees and almost all of their life in eucalyptus trees. They sleep most of the day and the rest is spent sitting. They almost never drink water , and they feed on eucalyptus leaves, which they eat a lot and digest well. An adult koala eats about 500 grams of fresh leaves a day. Although there are more than 600 kinds of eucalyptus to choose from, koalas just feed on 30 of them.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DzQyp8"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/07/DzQyp8.jpg" alt="DzQyp8.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Nowadays, human activities, forest fires and climate change are the main threats to koala. As a result of the loss of habitat, the difficulty of restoring burned forests, climate change and the disease, the population of Koala in Australia has declined significantly. They are included in IUCN Red List of Endangers Species.</p>

    <title>making poster and notice for the flea market</title>
    <url>/2020/11/25/making-poster-and-notice-for-the-flea-market/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The Student Union plans to organize the flea market. As a member of activity department, I took on the responsibility to make the poster for the flea market.</p>
<p>Since I have never made one myself before, I found information online to choose an app that most people recommend for making the poster, then I found one called canva, and that helps a lot.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9QfO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9QfO.jpg" alt="Dd9QfO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The poster and the notice should include all the details of the flea market. The details were from the PPT that the other member did, so my work was copying the details and arranged them in a more attractive way. The task sounds pretty simple, but actually it took me a lot of time. </p>
<p>For the poster, it needs to be attractive, succinct and clear, but I mixed the concept with that of a notice’s totally, that made the poster a complex one. Luckily I were aware of my mistake, then corrected it in time. The poster was soon complicated and passed the audit of the minister of activity department.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9sXj"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9sXj.jpg" alt="Dd9sXj.jpg"></a></p>
<p>A big problem came when I was making the notice. The app I chose couldn’t support to design a form. Additionally, the form was needed to include all the items that students could take to school. So I asked my minister for help. She was very enthusiastic to help me and made a form with  transparent background in the form of a picture, then I managed to uploaded it on the notice.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9WNV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9WNV.jpg" alt="Dd9WNV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I finished the poster and the notice before the deadline, and the minister praised me for my high efficiency. From this event, I found how greatly a right tool or app and help from others influence the result. I won the praise and trust from the minister, that is a good beginning for organizing activities in Student Union.</p>

    <title>the feeling after attending FBLA</title>
    <url>/2020/10/06/the-feeling-after-attending-FBLA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>​                                                      The feeling after attending FBLA</p>
<p>​                                                              参加FBLA社团的感想</p>
<p>Recently,I have been a member of a club  set in our school called FBLA. Our first task is setting a virtual company to provide goods for the coming Food Festival in January next year.</p>
<p>入学后我加入了一个叫作FBLA的社团.我们小组的第一个任务是创建一个虚拟的公司为明年一月份的校园美食节做准备.</p>
<p>The activity sounds great ,but we actually meet a lot of problems. Our group has six girls,but at first when we discussed the name of the group on wechat ,I found some of girls were too shy to come up with ideas,so they kept silence. Our group leader felt annoyed about it,so she sent some words in the wechat group,mainly to encourage the teammates to be more active and tell us their thoughts. That really worked. The goods we would produce were soon decided,so did Plan ABC. Yesterday a questionnaire about the advice the students in our school would like to give us was also done. Anyway ,the work we do together is more and more efficient.</p>
<p>这个活动听上去非常有意思，但实际上我们遇到了很多问题。我们小组的组员是六个女孩，但我发现一开始谈论小组名称的时候，一些女孩因为含羞从不提出建议。组长有点恼火，然后在微信群里发了些消息，大概意思就是想让组员们畅所欲言。这方法奏效了。我们小组很快确定了商品并制作了方案ABC。就在昨天，为了调查全校同学对方案的建议，一份电子版调查问卷新鲜出炉。我们越来越高效了。</p>
<p>Here is the feeling about the teamwork.</p>
<p>以下是我对这次活动的初步感受。</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be active and always share thoughts when solving problems in a group,or the efficiency would be particularly low when all the teammates keep silence.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>在集体活动中保持活跃，保持沉默只会让工作变得低效。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be organized and divide the duty to each of the members. If several people deal with one together,that maybe a waste of time because everyone has a different idea,and the problem cannot be solved in a short period of time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>分配任务可以让工作变得更有条理。如果一群人做同一个任务，人多口杂必然会浪费时间。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be manful as our group leader did. Because she pointed out of other’s mistakes, they can be corrected as soon as possible ,and then avoid the waste of more time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>要学习组长的果断。她及时指出了组员的错误并让她们立刻改正，这样很好地避免了浪费更多的时间</em></p>
<p>Hope we can finish the task successfully in the next four months!</p>
<p>希望我们可以一起在接下来的四个月里顺利完成任务！</p>

    <title>transport presentation</title>
    <url>/2020/12/15/transport-presentation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We were given a task about transportation taken by teachers and students in Jinling High School. We needed to make a survey, collected data and made a presentation about it.</p>
<p>We first had a meeting discussing about what question should be included in the survey. We spent about one hour designing the questionnaire and finally found seventeen questions that maybe useful to analysis data. We also made an electronic version one online, then uploaded it and asked our classmates to help us finish one.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMTcaq"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMTcaq.jpg" alt="rMTcaq.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then we collected the data, and for every questions, we made a diagram analyzing how many percentages it took up. So that the difference could be easily recognized. Here are some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rM7WTI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rM7WTI.jpg" alt="rM7WTI.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHm9K"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHm9K.jpg" alt="rMHm9K.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMH8AI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMH8AI.jpg" alt="rMH8AI.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHJ4P"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHJ4P.jpg" alt="rMHJ4P.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After finishing analyzing, we started to make PPT. We chose several groups of data that were worth sharing, then searched information to support our guess to the data or give reasons. For example, to support the fact that most people thought too much private cars led to the urban congestion, I found out the accurate data. That was by the end of 2019, there were 2702000 cars in Nanjing, which was the seventeenth biggest all over the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/rMHrEn"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/15/rMHrEn.jpg" alt="rMHrEn.jpg"></a></p>
<p>During the process of making the PPT, every teammate coordinated well and finished their work before the deadline. Nobody complained about the great deal of work, and some boys that were good at making diagrams and PPT were very willing to help. I felt comfortable and satisfied working with these friends, and I hope that we can be teammates next time and do presentation together.</p>

    <title>writing a meeting memo</title>
    <url>/2020/11/17/writing-a-meeting-memo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We were asked to make a PPT to introduce British a few weeks ago. The task was having a meeting first, then writing a meeting memo before the PPT was done.</p>
<p>As the team leader, I took the responsibility to make a plan for the process. I first planned the deadline and sent it to our QQ group. The plan included everything we needed to do before the deadline.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DeCeYQ"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/17/DeCeYQ.jpg" alt="DeCeYQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>In the 13th of November, we had a meeting in the hall of the international department in JinLing High School, the meeting went successfully and efficiently as we decided every part well. The PPT includes fourteen parts ,which is the name of the country, environment, climate ,natural resources, population, the symbol, administrative area, traveling, diet, history, education system, economic, transport, culture. We divided these topics into several parts, and allocated them according to their difficulty.</p>
<p>The meeting memo was done soon.</p>
<p>I learned a lot according to this opportunity to be the team leader. A team leader must plan things well, and chose the group member wisely. I knew them well and I am familiar with their qualities,then we cooperated well with each other. That leads to the success of writing the meeting memo.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/De9oW9"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/17/De9oW9.jpg" alt="De9oW9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I am sure that we can deal with the rest process together perfectly.</p>

    <title>continuing our experiment in IYPT</title>
    <url>/2020/11/04/continuing-our-experiment-in-IYPT/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>We made a lot of conversations after getting the hard topic. Finally our team gave up the experimental variable value that was talked about before because the information related to this was too hard for us to understand. Finally ,we started our experiment about the relationship between the rotate speed and the height it reached .</p>
<p>Then here came a question about the facility,the equipment we found on taobao turned out to be useless. Therefore we made one by ourselves,and the material came from daily life,for example,the engine came from an electric fan. After comparing many ways,we decided to fix the hand helicopter on the engine by hot melt glue gun. The process was amazing ,and that was my first time using such a machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bg4Jf0"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/04/Bg4Jf0.jpg" alt="Bg4Jf0.jpg"></a></p>

<p>There came another question: How can we count the times when it was rotating and how to measure the height?Our tutor recommended an app ,but it was complex to use. At the end of the club,we used the  photo function of iPhone to slow down the speed and saw whether it worked well. It came out that the result was amazing，and the times it rotated could be counted clearly.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bg4h0H"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/04/Bg4h0H.jpg" alt="Bg4h0H.jpg"></a></p>
<p>From this experience,I learned a lot about how to choose a proper app to help analyze the data and how to use a machine that I had never used before. The two hours flew away quickly. In the end ,we not only recorded the experimental data,but also gained happiness and friendship between each other.</p>

    <title>the sports I do recently</title>
    <url>/2020/10/30/the-sports-I-do-recently/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>After entering senior high, I moved to the house that has a skating rink nearby. Then I started to learn to skate.</p>
<p>However it turns out to be difficult. After several sessions, I found it easy to keep balance on ice ,but it was hard to skate graceful or as pretty as my coach did. In addition,sometimes I couldn’t match up my waist with legs, so the center of gravity changed a lot during coasting.</p>
<p>Luckily,my coach was pretty patient with me. He taught one method and told me about the tips over and over again,then encouraged me to practice imitating him. At present,I have already done some simple action successfully. This gives me courage to continuing skating and learning more. Practice makes perfect!</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNa0u8"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNa0u8.jpg" alt="BNa0u8.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNasEQ"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNasEQ.jpg" alt="BNasEQ.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I made friend with a girl that graduated from the same senior high as mine,and she is now a student of an university in Canada. She was active and liked doing sports. She even set up a club called orienting when she was in high school and became the first proprietor. Because of the outbreak of corona virus,she stayed in Nanjing and worked as a dive coach. I knew her occasionally and soon became her student. She gave me advice on diving and encouraged me to pass a test to get a certification called Level 1,and that started my journey on diving.</p>
<p>Diving is a extreme sport so they are many things I should learn,like the equipment,the safety tips after getting deep in the sea.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures when I first learned how to dive into the water., the first step is great,and there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/BNdHeS"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/30/BNdHeS.jpg" alt="BNdHeS.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Besides these,I will start to join aerobics next week,and learn to play table tennis by myself with my classmates. Those kinds of sports make my spare time colorful.</p>

    <title>lemur</title>
    <url>/2020/12/02/lemur/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>About 1,600,000 years ago, Madagascar was a part of African continent. As time flew, Madagascar left Africa. According to the record of fossil, the first lemur-like animal appeared on the African continent 600,000 years ago before entering Madagascar.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKZWT"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKZWT.jpg" alt="DoKZWT.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKlwR"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKlwR.jpg" alt="DoKlwR.jpg"></a></p>
<p>There are twenty types of lemurs on Madagascar island, and because of the difference of environment and climate, their characteristics are different. They are generally small, with a dog-like face and move like monkeys. Their fur is brown and gray. Most of the time, they are gentle, careful and have a specially long tail.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoKzA1"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoKzA1.jpg" alt="DoKzA1.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMicD"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMicD.jpg" alt="DoMicD.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMK9f"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMK9f.jpg" alt="DoMK9f.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/DoMljg"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/12/02/DoMljg.jpg" alt="DoMljg.jpg"></a></p>
<p>They like enjoying the warmth of the sun, and it turns out that they are afraid of coldness. They depend on fruit on the island, and they care nothing but their families. When they jump from a tree to the ground in order to escape from enemies or find food or other reasons, it can be distinguished from normal monkeys, for they bend their back first then jump during movement.</p>
<p>Thanks to their isolated environment on Madagascar and islands nearby, they live without dangerous enemies. However, human deforestation is the leading cause of the lemur’s survival crisis, which has reduced the amount of space of them by 90 percent. Despite the terrible conditions, and important scientific value, Lexus still remain one of the least understood animals in the world.</p>
<p>Lemurs are listed on the IUCN Red List and the Washington convention CITES appendix I level to protect animals.</p>

    <title>Mock Trial</title>
    <url>/2020/12/19/Mock-Trial/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week our school played Mock Trial with Nanjing Foreign Language School A-level center. I tried my best in the activity, but the result was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The case was about the death of a girl. She played an important role in track and field team and  hooked on EPO to get award, but the pressure from daily life made her much too tired, then she died suddenly. Our team’s goal was to show judge the major responsibility of the girl’s coach. I acted as the witness, the girl’s best friend. The other two groups in our side acted as the girl’s mother and a specialist of steroid. Each witness had an attorney as their partner.</p>
<p>All the attorneys and witness had prepared the direct examination and cross examination for a few months, except the specialist and his attorney, who did not even know the whole chart of the competition. That made the process pretty hard when it was their turn to do direct examination and cross examination. The attorney couldn’t express his meaning clearly and didn’t know how to make an objection. At last, our score was twenty points lower than Nanjing Foreign Language School A-level Center.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think my performance was perfect, but the whole process depended on teamwork, that means anyone of us can’t be the one that encumber the group. Everyone should do their best, or the result is unfair who gets full preparation for it.</p>

    <title>math presentation</title>
    <url>/2020/12/19/math-presentation/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Last week, my friend and I made a presentation about the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the exterior angles. We divided our work as soon as we received the task. She would deal with the sum of the interior angles, and I would do the rest. I was asked to look for some exercise for our PPT.</p>
<p>Then we moved on. We searched a lot of information online, like how to prove the sum of the exterior angles for all polygons is 360. Then my friend sent me her part, and I combined it with mine. After that, I sent the PPT which was done then asked her to check whether there was some grammar mistakes or spelling mistakes in it. Before the day we did the presentation, I had a meeting with her to do a rehearsal together.</p>

<p>The presentation was successful since we were the only group that presented in English. Cooperating with that friend makes me feel extremely good, because she was hard-working and took the presentation seriously, and she never failed to send me files I asked before the deadline I gave her. Hope to work together with her next time.</p>

    <title>Pandora&#39;s box</title>
    <url>/2020/12/25/Pandora-s-box/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I wrote a poetry to memorize the unforgettable 2020.</p>
<p><u>Pandora’s box</p>
<p>2020 came on its cat feet</p>
<p>opening Pandora’s box secretly</p>
<p>disaster and pain flew out</p>
<p>making people suffer and scream </p>
<p>when the world was immersed in panic</p>
<p>a beam of light broke the dark</p>
<p>it lighted up the way and said</p>
<p>don’t worry</p>
<p>the hope is at the bottom of the box</u></p>
<p>After Prometheus stole the fire, Zeus severely punished him and turned his wrath on the mankind. He decided to create a new kind of disaster for them. Zeus ordered Herhuisto, the god of craftsmen, to make Pandora unique in the world and gave her a small delicate box a gift. Zeus let Hermes send her to earth and asked Erbimetus, brother of Prometheus, to marry her. One day after the wedding, Pandora opened the box because of curiosity, releasing hunger, disease, greed, jealousy, resentment, and the revenge throughout the land. </p>
<p>I soon came up with the story of Pandora’s box after knowing the theme of the competition was hope. In 2020, there was war, volcanic eruption in the Philippines, avalanche in Kashmir, locust plague in Africa, the collapse of Russia’s stadium, unknown disease in Nigeria, Brazil’s mysterious virus, breaking the Antarctic twenty degree… All this things were the disaster that was carelessly let out of. It made the death increase and mankind regard each other as an enemy. However what Zeus ignored was that the hope always came with disaster, and there will definitely be a day that the world is reborn.</p>

    <title>environmental problem</title>
    <url>/2021/01/02/environmental-problem/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I made a poster about global warming to call on people to pay attention to environmental problem. Most content were summarized from my chemistry book.</p>
<p>Carbon dioxide enters the air through respiration and burning and it is removed by plants during photosynthesis. Burning more fuel and cutting down the forests increase the problem. Burning less fossil fuel and planting more trees would help to solve it. Methane is also another factor that cause global warming. it is produced by animals such as cows, and it is a by-product of digesting their food. It emerges from both ens of the cow. Intriguingly, termites are also significant contributors to the methane in the atmosphere. In addition, it is produced by the decay of food and other dead organic matter. It is produced in large quantities by rice paddy fields and landfill sites. Treating organic water so that the methane could be collected and burnt as fuel would help solve the problem.</p>
<p>The global warming may cause problems. Glaciers and polar ice will melt. This will cause a rice in sea level, and low-lying land will be flooded. The surface temperature of the earth will increase. Deserts will spread and millions of people will have less water. Severe weather events will increase in frequency, and hurricanes and flooding will become more common. In some areas it may become easier to grow food crops but in others it will certainly become more difficult.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/spCQgO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/01/02/spCQgO.jpg" alt="spCQgO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>After making the poster, I got something that went beyond my book. When people focus on development in economic, they should not ignore the problem about problem of environment, this includes air pollution, water pollution, light pollution and so on, which really have a great influence on mankind.</p>

    <title>good results about FBLA</title>
    <url>/2021/01/09/good-results-about-FBLA/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, I joint a competition about economic and business plan. Before the examination, we were given a booklet covering all the points that would appear in the examination. Then after a month of self-study, the examination began in the evening of a weekday.</p>
<p>The content was complicated to me because I had never learned business plan before, and the points in the booklet were too much. However I memorized them as much as possible, and finally managed to remember most of the points in the booklet. I finished not only memorizing the points but also the example questions in the end of each chapter. During the process of the examination, I found that many of the questions were similar to the example questions on the booklet. That was really good luck.</p>
<p>The result came out a few days ago. For the economic. I got the qualification of being a candidate in the economic competition, and the qualification of advancing the final in business plan.</p>

<p>I hope that I could get good results in the final competition in Shanghai.</p>

    <title>giraffes</title>
    <url>/2021/01/21/giraffes/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Giraffes are the world’s tallest living land animals, standing up to 6 to 8 meters, weighing about 700 kilograms. Newborn cubs can be 1.5 meters tall.</p>
<p>Giraffes can’t live on grass, they can only live on leaves. Their tongue is long and can be used for feeding. They live in forests and were widely distributed in prehistoric times, even in China. They are found only in Africa, and there are two species remaining.</p>
<p>The long necks and long legs can help them get cool. They live in hot savanna, and due to their large surface, this is good for emission of heat. Their lung capacity is large, and this is good for taking fresh breath and scavenging. Because of their long legs, giraffes have difficulty in drinking water. Giraffes drink water by straddling their front legs or kneeling on the ground, and are easy to be attacked by other animals, so social giraffes tend not to drink together.</p>
<p>Giraffes don’t sleep too much, typically two hours a night, and sleep can sometimes put them at risk. Giraffes spend a full minute getting up from the ground, and this reduce their ability to escape during sleep.</p>
<p>Given that some giraffes are increasing, some are declining and some appear to be stable, the most useful and appropriate actions for giraffes will vary depending on ecological stability, national policies and legislation. In 2010, they were listed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</p>

    <title>Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo</title>
    <url>/2021/01/31/Nanjing-Hongshan-Forest-Zoo/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>When most of zoos in China had relatively primitive business models, Nanjing Hongshan Zoo cancelled animal performances and feeding. It began to pay attention to animal welfare and invested a lot of money in the improvement, protection and scientific research of animal living environment. However, due to the coronavirus, the income of the zoo declined greatly, leading to difficulties in the operation of the zoo. As a result of last year’s epidemic situation, the park lost more than $30 million in 220, and 40%of its revenue, ad lost more than 20 employees.</p>
<p>To deal with the situation, the Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo came up with an activity called adopting animals. It uploaded electronic animal adoption manual online, and called on people to choose animals. All they need to do is pay the fees for the animals they choose. They can get report of their animals twice a year, and have a close contact with their animals once a year. Everyone is excited and is willing to take part in such a interesting activity.</p>
<p>My class plan to adopt a panda, which is 3000 rmb every year, and I plan to adopt a leopard individually, which is 2000 rmb every year.</p>
<p>The activity is corresponded by many animal lovers, and I would like to be a volunteer in Nanjing Hongshan Forest Zoo. Hope the zoo can get through the crisis in the future.</p>

    <title>the proudest thing</title>
    <url>/2021/02/07/the-proudest-thing/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I study in the A level center in the International department of Jinling High School. I am a hard-working girl and always manage to deal with problems well. I particularly do well in maths and chemistry, and I very much enjoy studying independently. When I meet any academic problems like difficult homework or content in the process of preview, I always try to solve the problem myself first of all, then ask classmates or teachers if I still don’t understand. I am also warm-hearted, because I adopted a kitten which was abandoned during the coronavirus outbreak. I am very energetic and usually spend about two to three hours doing sports every week. For instance, diving is my favorite, and I have always imagined going diving in the deep sea, exploring various creatures and observing unknown species. My friends always praise me for having a high efficiency when doing homework, and the ability to prepare for several competitions like UKMT, FBLA and AMC or activities at the same time and usually getting good results. Many of them like asking me questions about the content of the lecture after class, and I enjoy discussing their problems with them. We always work as a group to prepare lessons for the class, which makes me feel fulfilled and delighted.</p>
<p>The activity I am most proud of was joining an organization called MMUN ( Montessori Model United Nations ). My topic was about environmental problems in the Mediterranean and the impact refugees had on the environment. I spent about four months researching this, in particular, how the United Nations dealt with it, offering recommendations on how to improve the situation, writing my draft speech which had to be altered several times, and finally going to the General Headquarters of the United Nations in the USA. Over two days, my group discussed international politics with students of my age from all over the world. The greatest feelings came when everyone had their eyes focused on me as I was delivering my speech. Although I was feeling nervous, a friendly smile from the chairman removed my feeling of tension and anxiety when I stood on the platform, talking about my personal suggestions to resolve the problems in the Mediterranean. This activity was both exciting and challenging because I had the chance to debate topics in the adult world and let my voice be heard. </p>

    <title>FBLA-Middle Level China Finals</title>
    <url>/2021/02/13/FBLA-Middle-Level-China-Finals/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The FBLA-Middle Level China Finals was held before the Chinese New Year. After several days’ preparation, we got ready for the competition.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yrcWqJ"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/13/yrcWqJ.jpg" alt="yrcWqJ.jpg"></a><br>Although this year the competition was held online, the opening ceremony was really inspiring. The most exciting part was a video about the blessing for all participants from presidents from all over the world, and I found out the presidents of Jiangsu province was in same school with me.<br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yrcvdA"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/13/yrcvdA.png" alt="yrcvdA.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yrcxII"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/13/yrcxII.png" alt="yrcxII.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yrgEZj"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/13/yrgEZj.png" alt="yrgEZj.png"></a><br><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yrgKzT"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/13/yrgKzT.jpg" alt="yrgKzT.jpg"></a><br>The competition lasted for four days, and our group met some problems as well.<br>It was very hard to prepare for the presentation part. This year the topic was showing three business plan with innovative ideas. After some discussion with partners and our teacher, we decided to talk about cheongsam. The three business plan were about physical stores for cheongsam, online shop for clothes and exhibitions to advertise traditional consumers. We made PowerPoint separately, and decided to combine it. After combining I found the total time was too long and that might make our team lose points. We tried hard to delete content, but it was a formal business plan that must include eight to nine parts. We deleted time spent on each PowerPoint, thinking it met the judges’ satisfaction. However, because some technical problems when doing the online presentation, it took some time for me to test the equipment, our presentation was interrupted because it was too long. I felt really upset for that because we stayed up late, making powerpoint but still failed to finish the whole process. This experience reminds me to take full preparation before anything.<br>The mistake influenced a lot, but we still get a good grade. For the presentation, we got the National 18th place,and for individual project about business calculation, I got the National 17th place. That was the best gift I received before the Chinese New Year!</p>

    <title>Diving in Nanjing Aquarium</title>
    <url>/2021/02/23/Diving-in-Nanjing-Aquarium/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>During the holiday of Chinese Spring Festival, I went to Nanjing Aquarium to dive.</p>
<p>At first, I was very nervous because the sea creations around me all look so strange, or even more, ugly. There were also two large sea turtle and two sharks which were almost as large as me. However, after a few minutes’ adaptation, I was getting used to the light, the fishes around me and the people under the aquarium who took photos for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yL38sI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/23/yL38sI.jpg" alt="yL38sI.jpg"></a></p>

<p>I dived for two hours in the aquarium, and I found diving is a really interesting sport which needs divers to be brave enough to face the difficulties and danger in an oxygen-free environment. It is lucky for me to overcome my fear for the underwater world after receiving the invitation from my coach. Unfortunately, I still didn’t have the courage to take a photo with sharks. Hope I could be brave enough next time.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgchr.com/i/yL34SJ"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/02/23/yL34SJ.jpg" alt="yL34SJ.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Diving is so interesting!</p>

    <title>Piper</title>
    <url>/2021/03/01/Piper/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever be impressed by positive energy or relationship between friends? I felt like this when I watch “Piper” made by Disney. I would like to recommend it because I am deeply touched by the warm-heated plot.</p>
<p>The short movie tells the story of a baby piper, who always sit in nest, waiting her mum to bring her food until one day she got nothing, which means she has to seek food independently. However, she is strongly hit by wave then huddles in her net. Will she overcome her fear to the sea? I won’t spoil the story by telling you what the result is, but I can confirm the process is stunning.</p>
<p>This animation happens near a mesmerizing sea, which tells a story about the growth of a piper with the help of her friend, a hermit crab. One of the thing I learned from watching this animation is how important a friend acts in one’s growth. In the movie, for example, the piper learns how to prevent herself from being washed away by sea wave when seeking food by imitating what the crab does, and in this way she sees what the charming under-water world is like. It made me think about the importance of bravery and friends.</p>
<p>The movie provides a vivid story and rewarding insight into the growth of kids. People of all ages will find it particularly fascinating.</p>

    <title>unconditional offer of IC global summer school</title>
    <url>/2021/03/14/unconditional-offer-of-IC-global-summer-school/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The IGCSE final exams are coming in May and June, which means I will be free after that until September, so I planned to apply for a global summer school to make my summer holiday colorful.</p>
<p>After comparison and reference, I chose to apply for the global summer school of Imperial College. The process of application was mare complicated than I thought. During this process, I met large amount of problems. One of them was the predicted grade. There are two girls named Judy in my class, so my Center Principle gave me the wrong report at first. Then I had to double check with him through email because it was already the winter holiday when I started to apply. It took a long time to receive the correct predicted graded.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/6BmGtA"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/03/14/6BmGtA.png" alt="6BmGtA.png"></a></p>
<p>Another one is the system I studied in. I studied in a international department of a Chinese normal high school, so some of my courses are not belong to A-level but Gaokao system. I thought it was unnecessary to upload my score of courses of Gaokao system, so I didn’t. As a result, the Global Summer School team asked all my score on email. I apologized for my misunderstanding and sent my final report for last semester</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/6BmJfI"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/03/14/6BmJfI.png" alt="6BmJfI.png"></a></p>

<p>The application went smoothly, and I got my conditional offer at the first day of Chinese New Year, then received the unconditional offer after uploading further personal details. That was the best New Year present I have ever received!</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/6BmU6f"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2021/03/14/6BmU6f.png" alt="6BmU6f.png"></a></p>

    <title>feeling about AMC</title>
    <url>/2021/03/20/feeling-about-AMC/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The AMC came in February in winter holiday. I had prepared it for a long time, but still failed to get to the final. After hearing the bad news, I thought about it and drew the conclusion for my failure.</p>
<p>Firstly, I tried to achieve lots of tasks while preparing for the competition. I overestimated myself, for I could not handle so much work at same time actually. I believed I could do well, but it turned out that I was wrong.</p>
<p>Secondly, I went to the extra class for the AMC every Monday before the real competition, which was taught by teachers of American Program. The point and some theories were taught to us very clearly, and large quantities of formulas were provided too, but I didn’t review them before the competition because I was busy with another competition the day before the AMC. I felt regretful during the competition when I saw a question that could be solved by a formula the teacher had taught to us but I forgot.</p>
<p>The failure showed my limited ability to handle several competitions. I should adjust my timetable when I met this situation next time.</p>

    <title>Euclid Contest</title>
    <url>/2021/04/18/Euclid-Contest/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I took part in the Euclid Contest in 8th of April, organized by University of Waterloo. </p>
<p>Since I was busy preparing with the other test, I didn’t practice doing previous papers as I did. Instead of practicing over and over again, I searched the result last year and read the global average score of each question. The contest covers ten questions. In 2019, The average of each score from the first one to the last was 9.4, 9.2, 8.9, 7.5, 4.8, 3.6, 5.0, 2.5, 3.5 0.4. According to this result, I drew the conclusion that the in most cases the first question was well done by most students all over the world. From the second one to the fourth one, the score and a slightly shake, which means they were harder but most students still manage to do it. From the fifth one to the ninth one, they were much more difficult but there were still many correct final answers for part (a). The tenth was the most difficult question through the whole paper. It was very challenging and involved understanding complicated point. According to my analysis, I thought I would have no difficulty in doing the first seven questions and more time should be spent on the final three questions. </p>
<p>I only did one paper and my analysis was right. The I did the first seven questions successfully, and the final three was tough as I thought.</p>
<p>After I had a briefly understanding of how difficult the Euclid Contest was, I went for the competition this confidence. The paper was not so difficult, and I am very looking forward to checking the final result.</p>

    <title>apply for 2021FBLA Emerging Leaders Award</title>
    <url>/2021/05/28/apply-for-2021FBLA-Emerging-Leaders-Award/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I filled out the entry form as soon as I read the email sent by FBLA about the Emerging Leaders Award. They   sent the Leadership Profile after a few days and asked me to write two mini essay. This leadership profile aims to guide students to achieve their leadership potential by developing leadership awareness, skills and values. The ELA Leadership profile is designed according to leadership qualities and characteristics and is divided into three sections: self-awareness, communication and empowerment. Here are my two essays.</p>
<p>self-motivation</p>
<p>I study in the A level center in the International department of Jinling High School. I am a hard-working girl and always manage to deal with problems well. When I meet any academic problems like difficult homework or content in the process of preview, I always try to solve the problem myself first of all, then ask classmates or teachers if I still don’t understand. My friends always praise me for having a high efficiency when doing homework, and the ability to prepare for several competitions at the same time and usually getting good results. Many of them like asking me questions about the content of the lecture after class, and I enjoy discussing their problems with them. We always work as a group to prepare lessons for the class, which makes me feel fulfilled and delighted.</p>
<p>The activity I am most proud of was joining an organization called MMUN ( Montessori Model United Nations ). My topic was Strengthening of Security and Cooperation in the Mediterranean Region, mainly focused on the environmental problems in the Mediterranean and the impact refugees had on the environment. I spent about four months researching this, in particular, how the United Nations dealt with it, offering recommendations on how to improve the situation, writing my draft speech which had to be altered several times, and finally going to the General Headquarters of the United Nations in the USA. Over two days, my group discussed international politics with students of my age from all over the world. The greatest feelings came when everyone had their eyes focused on me as I was delivering my speech. Although I was feeling nervous, a friendly smile from the chairman removed my feeling of tension and anxiety when I stood on the platform, talking about my personal suggestions to resolve the problems in the Mediterranean. In other parts of the meeting like formal and informal debate, I actively participated into it and provided several suggestions as a delegate of Nigeria. The final document finally came out with the efforts of many people, and the country I represented, Nigeria became one of the supported country. This activity was both exciting and challenging because I had the chance to debate topics in the adult world, and my voice would be heard because all of our suggestions will be given to the United Nations. It shows that whatever we do in this world will have an impact on the course of the world. Creative thinking, critical thinking, communication skills, research learning fit into the society where knowledge is constantly changing, renewing and developing. These can make us the power to change the world.</p>
<p>relationship building</p>
<p>I had always thought my communication skill is good enough to help me get along well with people I first work with until my English teacher asked me to work with a boy in my class and make a poster. At that time we were learning the words that describe the quality of people, so I chose a topic similar to it, and was pretty sure that I could learn more than books from that process. It turned out that it was true, and I actually learned something far more than I thought. </p>
<p>The boy was active and thoughtful, which I thought was fantastic because his creative mind may contribute a lot to our poster. The fact was I found myself couldn’t keep up with him as he always came up with suggestions of the illustration, but I wanted to focus on the paragraph first then use simple illustration that matched with the content. He argued that our poster would be the most attractive one even if the illustration didn’t match the paragraph, then we would be the winner. I tried to communicate with him, but it seemed that he couldn’t accept any of mt words. Both of us were angry to each other, while I thought it was ridiculous to focus on the decoration instead of the content, and he thought I was unkind because I didn’t allow him to draw whatever he wanted.</p>
<p>I thought a lot that day, after my anger slowly drained away, about the method that balance the ideas of mine and his. Soon I came up with an idea and sent it to him on wechat. I asked him to draw on several pieces of paper and took them into class. The next day when I finished the paragraph on the paper, there was several blank space as I predicted, which could be filled with his paintings. Finally, we are both satisfied with the poster and were praised by our teacher.</p>
<p>From this experience, as far as I am concerned, everybody’s thought in a different way. When doing teamwork, one shouldn’t be completely submissive to others, and cling to their own thoughts harder and harder and keep their mind closed. The anger can solve nothing. The only way is calming down and thinking of a method that maximize ideas of both sides. I have been getting on well with that boy since then, and I believe both of us learning a lot from that unforgettable poster.</p>

    <title>apply for president&#39;s assistant</title>
    <url>/2021/06/07/apply-for-president-s-assistant/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I heard that the Ive League Model United Nations Conference China organized by University of Pennsylvania was recruiting the president’s assistant for the meeting in the end of June. Since I had similar experience before, I applied it, after filling an enrollment form then got the inform of an interview.</p>
<p>I had never had an interview like this before, so I prepared a lot for it. I thought about the topic of the meeting I chose deeply and wrote a long prompt note in case I would be embarrassed if I had nothing to say. I also predicted some questions or speeches she may ask me to do, like self-introduction, and the topic I worked on previously, although it turned out that only a few of them were right.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the interview, she asked me to do a self-introduction in English firstly, then asked me some simple questions, like what I think a good assistant should be like, and whether I had experience before. The answers I gave were all in English. At the next stage, all the questions and answers were in Chinese, and it was harder. For instance, she asked what I could do if the other assistant and I lose contact with the chairman before the meeting. I was tense for the difficulty of the question, and the silence lasted for a few silence, then I knew that I have to say something to relieve my tension. I said I would contact the other assistant and asked him whether he could contact the chairman, and if it didn’t work, we would help the chairman complete the meeting because we would get familiar with the process. The other tough one was, if there was silence during the process of debate, what I would do. My answer was I would talk my opinion first I order to stimulate their mind, but I believed the delegates were all excellent students from all over the country, so it may not happen.</p>
<p>The interview lasted for only fifteen minutes, but it taught me lot. The clam and peaceful mind was important in such a case, and maybe I would prepare more sufficiently next time.</p>

    <title>do we need Greta</title>
    <url>/2021/06/10/do-we-need-Greta/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Greta Thunberg, a Swedish environmentalist, has been active for the past years, with angry images appearing on news media and social pages. By protesting and condemning people’s pollution of the environment, the Green Girl has become a front-runner for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Do we need Greta? Whether she did anything valuable should be analyzed clearly.</p>
<p>Since September in 2018, when Greta was 15 years old, she started to stage a sit-in in front of the Swedish parliament building to protest against the government’s lack of environmental protection, but the way she did it was striking. With the help of the Internet, Greta soon became a famous people. Then she came up with an idea called Friday for Future, and called on teenagers all over the world to absent from school. 1,400,000 teenagers from 139 countries went striking with the slogan of protecting the environment. After that, Greta was invited to many countries to give speeches.</p>
<p>Once she was invited to United States, announcing that she would go there by sea instead of plane, because the ship was more environment-friendly, but the fact was the ship she took, Malizia, II, was worth ten million dollar, and had to be piloted by a professional team and followed by a helicopter. After she arrived the US, the ship will have to find a way back to Europe, and the team will have to fly back. The carbon emissions were astonishing.</p>
<p>Putin’s words got the point,”Environmental protection is not a publicity stunt. Using children to meet their own interests should be blamed.”</p>

    <title>personal goal</title>
    <url>/2021/06/18/personal-goal/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I took part in FBLA-Middle Level China last winter holiday, for I had made up my mind to get a national place in such a competition. FBLA stands for Future Business Leaders of America, which is an organization that holds business-themed competitions annually. The competition is made up of individual and group projects. For the group projects, the final score is the combination of a paper score and a presentation score. My teammates and I started to make PowerPoint presentations and wrote our business plans as soon as the Final Semester Examination had finished. We had never done anything like this before, so our tutor gave us a model of a business plan and asked us to study it first. At that time it was only half a month before the competition started. My teammates and I stayed up late in order to work on our plan. After we had finished our Powerpoint presentation, we sent it to our tutor and asked for some advice. She gave us feedback after a few days and asked us to research the Internet and learn more deeply about topics relevant to our plan, which concerned the cheongsam industry. Moreover, she also mentioned small details like the accuracy of our grammar, the language used and the pictures added in each slide. We were very appreciative of the advice and quickly modified the slides. We did a few rehearsals of the presentation and the outcome was as good as we expected - we got the national 18th place.</p>
<p>I really learned a lot from this experience. As well as writing a business plan myself, I experienced the feeling of pursuing a goal that I had set. Although staying up late made me feel exhausted, the sense of success I felt after the announcement of the winner list made me feel that the effort was worthwhile. I am much more willing to take on a challenging task after the competition, because the confidence I gained from this experience helps me to see that I can do anything as long as I stay focused on it.</p>

    <title>rejection letter</title>
    <url>/2021/06/22/rejection-letter/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I received the announcement about the result of 2021 ILMUNC AD Interview. Unfortunately, the email said they decided not to proceed with my application because some of the candidates were more closely matched with their current requirement.</p>
<p>I analyzed the reason why I was rejected, and it turned out to be several points. Firstly, I didn’t put too much effort into the preparation of the interview, because the motivation of the enrollment for this position was only that I had similar experience before and I was curious about the job of AD. Secondly, the personal statement made me get the qualification of interview because I emphasized the experience I had, which met the standard of the interviewer. However, what I hadn’t thought about was most of the students who got the qualification had experience like me, so it was unnecessary for me to emphasize it during the interview. Third, since I had similar experience as other candidates did, what made us different was the performance, like the mental speed and the confidence I showed and whether the answer I gave her was proper or not.</p>
<p>I thought it would be fantastic if I could be the AD instead of delegates after three years of personal growth. The result showed I was conceited and I underestimated the level of other candidates. It was still a long way to go.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today we spent the whole day in the STEAM lab in our school. I saw lots of machines and equipment I had never seen before. </p>
<p>In the morning we were allowed to make whatever we liked, and most of us chose to make fridge magnets by modeling on the computer, sending the blueprint to the laser cutting machine then assembling components together. I struggled to model it at the beginning because I was not familiar with the app, but soon getting used to it. </p>
<p>We did the items according to the course our teacher sent us on the computer, the process went smoothly. I did two fridge magnets and a music box whose lid could be rotated. </p>
<p>There are the two fridge magnets and the music box ( disassembled ).</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the third day studying theories and experiment.</p>
<p>In the morning, we learned the basic principles of hemagglutination and hemagglutination inhibition test. The virus can agglutinate with chicken red blood cells, known as hemagglutination. This kind of erythrocytes agglutination can be inhibited by specific immune serum, which is the erythrocytes agglutination inhibition test. We will do the test tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we did follow-up work of the experiment we did in the first day. The chicken embryo died because of the Newcastle disease virus and was freezer in refrigerator at 4 degree centigrade. The air chamber is crushed and Newcastle disease virus is extracted. We compared the chicken embryo with normal one, and found that our chicken embryo was red and had several bleeding spots on its body. </p>

<p>The day flew and I expect the hemagglutination test very much.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the second day studying in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>We learned about the types of vaccine and the technology of virus inactivation. Then we entered the lab, and spent the rest day in the lab, doing experiment about artificial bacteria </p>
<p>propagation.</p>
<p>The first step was the configuration of LB solution. Then we used high temperature and pressure sterilization technology. Then we waited until the solution cool down at 55 degree Centigrade and poured into the Petri dish. The plate inoculation method after it solidifies, which made it easier for bacteria to absorb nourishment.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/WCt50s"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/11/WCt50s.jpg" alt="WCt50s.jpg"></a></p>

<p>The skill needed today was teamwork, number skill and use of IT. We cooperated with each other during the process of configuration of solution of PBS and LB. PBS is the solution of KH2PO4, NaCl , KCl and other substances, while LB is made up of agar, albumen powder and so on. Everyone measured several types of substance, and we all did a good job. The laboratory provided a list of solution proportions for 1000 ml, but we needed less LB solution. We must do calculations before measurement, and we all did the measurement accurately. We searched on the Internet about the questions the teacher gave us: how we know the existence of virus, and the relationship between vaccine preparation and bacteria culture. The Internet gave us satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>I an getting well with my new friends, and I am looking forward for the third day .</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the last day of the journey. We spent the morning preparing the presentation and gave the report in the afternoon. The presentation went well, and it was the last thing I did in the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>I really learned a lot from the process of study. I understood the general process of production of biological vaccine, and how they worked when they were injected into human body. The experiment of the chicken embryo vaccination, coagulation and extraction of venom helped me learn more about the production chain. </p>
<p>As more new types of COVID-19 were discovered, it is impossible for human to wipe them out. The relationship of mutualism will continue, and one of the most effective way to protect ourselves is vaccination. I am very appreciate for the effort of the doctoral supervisor and his students, who devoting themselves to the project in the past five days.</p>
<p>It will be my pleasure if there are other activities like this in the future.</p>

    <url>/2021/07/09/biological-vaccines-4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the fourth day doing experiments in the lab.</p>
<p>In the morning, we did experiment called agglutination of coagulation. Here is my experimental report.</p>
<p>The purpose of the experiment</p>
<p>The purpose of the experiment is to master the basic principle, operation method and determination of result of coagulation experiment.</p>
<p>The principle </p>
<p>Some blood cells of some animals have some kind of viral receptor, and they cause the agglutination of coagulation when meeting typical virus.</p>
<p>Apparatus </p>
<p>Incubator, egg tray, sterile forceps, spirit burner, 3%iodine tampon, 75%alcohol tampon, sterile collection tube, 96-well micro coagulant reaction board, micro converter, sterile gun head.</p>
<p>Reagent</p>
<p>Virus suspension, positive virus suspension, PBS, 1% chicken erythrocytes suspension.</p>
<p>The step</p>
<p>\1. Run on a 96-well V-shaped micro plate and add micro liters to each hole from left to right except for the 11th hole, adding 50 micro liters of PBS.</p>
<p>\2. Add 25 micro liters of solution of virus to the first well from the left and suck 25 micro liters to the second well after evenly mixing. </p>
<p>3.Add 1% red blood cells of chicken to each well from left to right. Shake the reaction plate slightly and make the blood cells and virus fully fixed. Then act in the temperature box of 37 degree v</p>
<p>centigrade for 15-30 minutes until the red cells have precipitated and the result can be observed.</p>
<p>Notifications</p>
<p>\1. Timeliness if reslut determination.</p>
<p>\2. Shaking red blood cells well before using it.</p>
<p>\3. Using pipetting gun which is used to add sample must be accurate and try not to have bubbles</p>

    <url>/2021/07/06/biological-vaccines/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I had arrived in Beijing and got ready to enter the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. I will spend five days here, entering the lab and studying deeply about the preparation of biological vaccine. </p>
<p>Today is the first day of the experiment. Firstly we learned the ways of embryo inoculation like allantoic cavity inoculation, yolk sac inoculation, eye vaccination and so on. Moreover, I also had a rough idea of functions of structure of chicken embryo and function of each part. I felt like I entered a new field, since I had never accessed into this area before.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/WCJj8U"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/07/11/WCJj8U.jpg" alt="WCJj8U.jpg"></a></p>

<p>Secondly, I entered into the lab and did the experiment myself. Here is my report.</p>
<p>The purpose of the experiment</p>
<p>The purpose of the experiment is to learn the virus and the choices of the experimental animal, understand the basic structure and function of chicken embryo, and master the method of inoculation of chicken embryo.</p>
<p>The experimental principle</p>
<p>The chicken embryo is a living animal organism with a low degree of tissue differentiation. A large amount of venom can be produced in the tissue and liquid of the inoculated chicken embryo by choosing different age and ways of inoculation.</p>
<p>Apparatus</p>
<p>Grooved bit, egg candler, incubator tray, pencil, spirit burner, wax, 1 ml syringe, tweezer, bio-safety cabinet, incubators.</p>
<p>Experimental reagent</p>
<p>SPF chicken embryo, virus strain, alcohol cotton, iodine tincture cotton, 75% alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>Experimental procedure</p>
<p>\1. Candling the egg and find the head of chick embryo with help of egg candler with the egg heads up. Marking the air chamber and punching a hole 0.5 cm.</p>
<p>\2. Disinfection. Iodine tincture cotton was used to disinfect the air chamber. Alcohol cotton was used after 10 mins.</p>
<p>\3. Drilling. Use a punch to punch a hole in the marked place.</p>
<p>\4. Inoculation. Use a 1 ml syringe to absorb the viral material. The general inoculation is 0.1ml or 0.2ml.</p>
<p>\5. Sealing with wax. Sealing the eggshell with wax and the chicken embryos were incubated in an incubator at 37 degree centigrade.</p>
<p>Pollution prevention</p>
<p>The whole process of inoculation requires aseptic operation, and result of death 24 days after inoculation is not considered.</p>
<p>The first day staying in the lab is fantastic, and I am looking forward for the experiment took in the following days.</p>

    <title>be a volunteer</title>
    <url>/2021/07/20/be-a-volunteer/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I have always wanted to be a volunteer and helped the disabled, and the opportunities came with the help of my mum. She recommended a center to me, and today I spent the whole afternoon there.</p>
<p>It was a totally new world to me after I stepped into the center. The disabled there were of all ages, and some of them even had adult-looks faces but with intelligence quotient of 4-10 years old. One of the boy, who was naughtier than others, even robbed a pair of glasses from a young volunteer. Another boy walked towards us crankily, saying hello to me with his face closely to my nose. The group leader introduced the brief information of the center to us, and asked us not to share our snack with them in case of mentality of begging.</p>
<p>I was asked to help a boy named XinXin during the class. He couldn’t give immediate reaction, and my job was to remind him to participate in class. The teacher taught them to distinguish the direction patiently, but it seemed that it was too hard to them to distinguish left and right. During the class, I kept on reminding the boy of what the teacher said. The boy sitting next to him with problems of oral cavity even couldn’t pronounce more than two words, which made me feel really pity.</p>
<p>The activity teaches me a lot. It shows me that there are still a number of people living a different life from us, and they need people to teach them essential living skills. What we can do is to do we can to help them, and wish them to integrate into society as soon as possible.</p>

    <title>social media</title>
    <url>/2021/07/24/social-media/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>From social media to social impact.</p>
<p>link: <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/amonge_sinxoto_from_social_media_to_social_impact_jan_2019">https://www.ted.com/talks/amonge_sinxoto_from_social_media_to_social_impact_jan_2019</a></p>
<p>The presenter emphasized that social media makes everything accessible and gives support to make everyone’s voice heard. She came up with four key points to support her idea, which is investing in a cause, finding people who have passion, preparing and populating a remedy, and be consistent with one’s idea.</p>
<p>Obviously, social media provides a platform for active mind, allowing them to spread, and be known to more people. The presenter gave us the example of the invitation of giving speech for several famous university, or even chatting with president, after she decided to stop waiting for someone else to speak on behalf on African teenagers. However, that is the positive side of the social media. There are still presence of unhealthy websites, and extremist publish reactionary views on the Internet. The negative impact the social media brings to the society can not be ignored.</p>
<p>Why you should quit social media?</p>
<p>link:<a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/cal_newport_why_you_should_quit_social_media?fbclid=IwAR3t_FIS0_FsAhiPAeT0hVijOgg0YFOIeR76wuzUCrePAvT-lkixxXWIP6o">https://www.ted.com/talks/cal_newport_why_you_should_quit_social_media?fbclid=IwAR3t_FIS0_FsAhiPAeT0hVijOgg0YFOIeR76wuzUCrePAvT-lkixxXWIP6o</a></p>
<p>The presenter called on audiences to quit social media. His brief idea was that he still had friend,  knew what was going on in the world and collaborated with people all around the world. People would be happier and have more sustainability.</p>
<p>I partly agree with the idea that social media is one kind of entertainment, and is designed to be addictive. Moreover, they may have negative impact such as permanently reducing one’s capacity for concentration. However, the presenter denied the potential opportunities provided by social media, which seemed to be ridiculous because it is quite obvious that social media provides job opportunities and brings benefits for self-media, and their followers, who is described as people who can be regardless by the presenter, are the major source of income for this industry</p>
<p>Social media&amp;Youth–an intricate relationship</p>
<p>link:<a href="https://vimeo.com/268987063">https://vimeo.com/268987063</a></p>
<p>It is always said that the Internet has a negative impact on people – trapping them in a virtual world and causing metal damage, like depression, anxiety and procrastination.</p>
<p>The presenter mentioned the cycle of damage, who said we always shared happiness, like family gathering and lively parties, which would make a lonely people feel much lonelier if he saw them on social media. However, as far as I am concerned, that’s not always the case. Firstly, there are still large amount of people who spread there negative emotion on the Internet, so what the presenter said doesn’t always happen. Moreover, for students who stay aboard on their own and feel lonely, chatting with friends or parents and sharing stories is a kind of spiritual comfort. This may be a motivation for them to move on. The opinion the presenter shares is for special cases only.</p>
<p>Could social media envy be good to you?</p>
<p>link:<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/video/social-media-envy-could-it-be-good-for-you/">https://www.cbsnews.com/video/social-media-envy-could-it-be-good-for-you/</a></p>
<p>There are two kinds of envy exist. Benign envy is good envy which provides motivation, while malicious envy is a feeling of undercutting others so that they look better. The social media envy being talked about is benign envy. People most like us and the people we connect to are the people most like us, so we feel it’s attainable in order for us to feel envy. </p>
<p>We were taught to chase others and go beyond them if it is possible, and I believe most of us grow up with this kind of mentality. Neijuan (involution) is a specific name for this phenomenon. When being compare to others, people are always guilty with themselves of their weakness. I have to say it is a inspiring atmosphere for young people who just graduated, entering the society to work, but it may put too much stress on the middle-aged.</p>

    <title>summer school Day1</title>
    <url>/2021/08/02/summer-school-Day1/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the first day of the journey of study in IC global summer school online. The summer school lasts from 2nd to 13th of August. The timetable below is the course arrangement for the following weekdays. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fm9OMT"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/06/fm9OMT.png" alt="fm9OMT.png"></a></p>

<p>The welcome activities are more exciting than I thought. I met my teammates online, and played several games. The mentor asked someone several question, then the student answered it, chose another students to run the cycle. After a couple of turns, we knew each other well. My teammates came from Tai, America, China, Singapore and France. The difference of color made me feel amazing about the culture, and it would be fantastic to study and discuss academic topic with them. </p>
<p>There was not too much lectures in the first day. What we learned was called empowering patients, and the key information for health coaching was briefly introduced. The professor showed us two videos after that, as well as asking us to point out what kind of strategy they used.</p>
<p>Here are my notes for the lecture. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fm9jLF"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/06/fm9jLF.jpg" alt="fm9jLF.jpg"></a></p>

<p>From that lecture, I understood the theory in a more realistic way. It may look unpractical if we didn’t combine it with real events, and that makes it sensible and logic.</p>

    <title>lying flat</title>
    <url>/2021/08/08/lying-flat/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I read about a piece of news on New York Times, which caught my eyes and I wrote down my comments. Please click the link below for the news.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/03/world/asia/china-slackers-tangping.html</a></p>
<p>Here is my comment.</p>
<p>It’s a common sight: as our teacher passes back our tests, students who tried their best and still failed lean back in their chairs, put their hands to their faces, and sigh that they’re going to lie flat and sleep forever. Then a few moments go by, they open their eyes, see their classmates still working away, sigh again, and get back to the grind. </p>
<p>For most of my friends in China, “tangping” is just an internet buzzword, a meme that we use to describe our plans whenever we work hard but don’t succeed. The more popular term is “neijuan,” which means “rolling inside,” or “involution.” It’s the yin to tangping’s yang. If lying flat means giving up the struggle, then involution means internalizing it, taking the cutthroat competition for limited resources and making it into a cutthroat competition with one’s self: working harder, sleeping less, giving up more, and always feeling like it’s still not enough. </p>
<p>As the competition grows fiercer, so do the consequences, which are felt unevenly across members of my generation. Every year, around the time that university entrance exams take place, we hear about another spate of high school suicides, students so involuted that they turned themselves inside out. This article reminded me that another way exists, even if I don’t feel like lying flat is a realistic option for me. The choice between rolling inward and rolling over isn’t much of a choice at all.</p>

    <title>summer school Day2</title>
    <url>/2021/08/03/summer-school-Day2/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Global Summer School of Imperial College Day2</p>
<p>Today is the second day of the summer school. The two topics was about urinary system and diabetes and obesity. </p>
<p>At the beginning of the lecture, the professor asked us to do a small quiz on <a href="http://www.mentimeter.com,/">www.mentimeter.com,</a> the questions were all about the content of area that I had never accessed into, and there were too many unfamiliar words. Seeing others went smoothly, I felt a little bit tense and helpless. </p>
<p>Then the lecture started. The slide below showed the structure of nephron. Then she explained the function of each part, mostly about what substances it absorbs or filters.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/f180cd"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/09/f180cd.md.png" alt="f180cd.md.png"></a></p>
<p>When it came to urinary dipstick test, thing sounded much easier to understand. The slide showed us the substances that the urine of patients may have, and professor told us how the symptom showed to us. I made a few notes of them with the help pf my classmates. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/f18HEV"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/09/f18HEV.png" alt="f18HEV.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/f18q4U"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/09/f18q4U.jpg" alt="f18q4U.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Then the professor gave several cases to us to discuss in the breakout room. After searching information online, I found the urinary dipstick test helpful, for it provided clues for diagnosis. The discussion went well. After that, we were told to gave patients advice for having a healthy kidney, and my point contributed a lot, like drinking a lot of water, urinating frequently, eating light food, paying attention to rest. Moreover, patients should have oral levofloxacion or cephalosporin if they have UTI for more than three times in a year. </p>
<p>In the evening the lecture about diabetes and obesity started. </p>
<p>Diabetes is a condition where the body cannot effectively process glucose. This causes blood sugar level to become too high. The slide below shows the structure of pancreas.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/f18OCF"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/09/f18OCF.png" alt="f18OCF.png"></a></p>
<p>However, why do we regulate blood glucose so carefully? Glucose is the primary source for most cell types. In particular, the brain depends on glucose as its major source of energy, neurons have high energy demand, requiring the continuous supply of glucose from the blood stream. In humans, the brain uses 20% of energy produced from glucose within the body, even though it only represents 2% of body mass. If glucose is so low, then all the physiological processes it fuels will be impaired. This causes hunger, trembling and sweating. Very low glucose will cause confusion as brain function is compromised, and in very severe cases, lots of consciousness.</p>
<p>Here is the difference between type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/f18jgJ"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/09/f18jgJ.png" alt="f18jgJ.png"></a></p>
<p>It is estimated that 400-500 million people are living with diabetes in the world(1 in 11 of the world’s adult population). Nearly half of people with diabetes are undiagnosed. It is currently the fifth most common reason for death on the world, and around 1 in 8 people between 20 and 79 years old have their death attributed to diabetes.</p>
<p>The two lectures today both emphasized the importance of diet and a good lifestyle. The advise I searched and told by professor is of great help.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the third day of global summer school organized by Imperial College. We spent the whole day studying cancer biology and infectious disease. </p>
<p>We firstly learned about cancer. It is an umbrella term that is given to a collection of related disease that are characterized by the formation of abnormal cells. Globally, it is estimated that just under 10 million people die from cancer every year, and it is the second most common cause of death. The human body consists of an estimated 37.2 trillion cells. In a healthy adult, around 242 billion cells are produced every day replacing the old ones, which die as a part of the well-regulated cell cycle. Cancer occurs when this orderly process is altered and cells start to grow and divide uncontrollably. In the majority of cases, these cells form a mass called a tumor, and it can form in almost any part of the body.</p>
<p>Although cancer can arise from a single abnormal cell, it is typically not a single mutation but rather a multistep process. Mutations in key molecular pathways can occur, and the accumulation of many mutations that build to create the final ‘cancer cell’. This is why most cancers are typically found at higher prevalence in older individuals. With an increasingly aging population this represents a significant healthcare burden.</p>
<p>The gragh below shows six key characters of hallmark of cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQIhjJ"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQIhjJ.png" alt="fQIhjJ.png"></a></p>
<p>The two-hit hypothesis.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQIIBR"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQIIBR.png" alt="fQIIBR.png"></a></p>
<p>What is the cause of cancer?</p>
<p>Approximately 15% of worldwide cancers are thought to be caused by viruses. Some examples include the Epstein-Barr Virus (Burkitts lymphoma) and hepatitis B/C virus (hepatocarcinoma).</p>
<p>Famously, the human papilloma virus(HPV) has been found to be the main cause of cervical cancer. Fortunately, whenever there is a virus, there is the potential for a vaccine.</p>
<p>For decades, scientists believed that bacteria couldn’t survive long term in the stomach as the environment was too hostile- we know differently know. Studies into the role of gut bacteria(microbiome) are everyday revealing the vital role these bacteria play in human health. One of the first bacteria to be identified was a special shaped bacteria, now called Helicobactor pylori. It was long believed that conditions such as stomach ulcers were caused purely by lifestyle factors such as stress or eating spicy foods. The discovery of H. pylori in 1984 by Barry Marshell, quickly led to recognition of the bacteria as being the primary cause of both ulcers and gastric cancer. It is estimated that around two out of every three people worldwide if infected with the bacteria. Most people have little to no symptoms as a result of the infection. However, gastric cancer being the 5th most commonly diagnosed cancer, and around 750,000 deaths annually. </p>
<p>In the next step, we learn the immune response. Here is the slide that briefly introduce this.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQIHN6"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQIHN6.png" alt="fQIHN6.png"></a></p>
<p>The immune system is consisted of several key components.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQIL9O"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQIL9O.png" alt="fQIL9O.png"></a></p>
<p>The slide shows the primary and secondary Lymphoid organs and immune cells location.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQoSHI"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQoSHI.png" alt="fQoSHI.png"></a>MSH II: professional antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells.</p>
<p>MCH I: nucleated cells including antigen presenting cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQIzDA"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQIzDA.png" alt="fQIzDA.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQo18U"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQo18U.png" alt="fQo18U.png"></a></p>
<p>Effect functions of B cells.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQocqA"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQocqA.png" alt="fQocqA.png"></a></p>
<p>Why the immune system is unable to fight cancer? Tumor cells hijack the immune system, inducing inflammation and promoting tumorigenesis. Continuous activation of the immune system can cause exhaustion or anergy leading to the immune system inability to fight properly. In some instances, the immune system cannot detect tumor cells, because cells of the immune system and tumour cells do not cross paths. Frequent mutations do not allow a proper detection of the tumour by the immune system.</p>
<p>Here are types of antigens.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQoRat"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQoRat.png" alt="fQoRat.png"></a></p>
<p>Native cytotoxic T cells reside in the secondary lymphoid organs.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQoxRU"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQoxRU.md.png" alt="fQoxRU.md.png"></a></p>
<p>Then we discussed about what aspect of the immune system we would modify to make the immune system more effective against tumor cells and explain why in the breakout room. I listened different ideas from my teammates, and was amazed by their creative and open thinking.</p>
<p>The slide shows the principle of immune checkpoint inhibitors.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQo7rj"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQo7rj.png" alt="fQo7rj.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is the introduction about how CAR-T cell therapy work.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQT9sJ"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/08/fQT9sJ.md.png" alt="fQT9sJ.md.png"></a></p>
<p>This was a very informative lecture, and I tried my best to take notes and participated. I watched the recording and caught up on my notes after the class. The feeling of self-study is better than I had ever had.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the fifth day of global summer school of Imperial college.</p>
<p>For the slides below is the heart of everything, which is just a model of DNA. It is not ture, but effectively show the reality. The double stranded helix of DNA is one of the key thing about it. It’s a little bit tricky to actually draw the gragh in this way, so that’s why the linear form of DNA is often drawn instead.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMpsU"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMpsU.png" alt="fMMpsU.png"></a></p>
<p>This slide show the real DNA, in a much more complex way.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMFo9"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMFo9.png" alt="fMMFo9.png"></a></p>
<p>Huge amount of work is being done to try and see what is a DNA is consisted of and how does it operate. They found that in every bacteria there are enzymes called restriction enzymes, which cut the DNA at specific points like this.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMEJ1"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMEJ1.png" alt="fMMEJ1.png"></a></p>
<p>To those pre-prepared fragment, the right sort of a DNA can be added to the sticky ends. The plasma originates from different type of bacteria, and the idea comes from considerable amount of effort and investigations. It was injected into bacteria, and they will use its own cellular machinery to produce the copies.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMQdH"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMQdH.png" alt="fMMQdH.png"></a></p>
<p>The professor briefly introduce an experiment to us and recommend a new technique called microinjection. The piece of DNA is extracted from the eggs of fruit fly, and after the process that taught above, the recombinant DNA is injected back to the egg. What happens in next stage depends on how the DNA is organized.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMGWt"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMGWt.png" alt="fMMGWt.png"></a></p>
<p>From the next two graghs, it is obvious to see that there is a big difference between female and male Mediterranean fruit fly. Female fruit flies are larger, and the end of there bodies look lighter than those of male fruit flies’. The life cycle of fruit fly is also introduced. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMMOmD"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMMOmD.png" alt="fMMOmD.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQE7Q"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQE7Q.png" alt="fMQE7Q.png"></a></p>
<p>However, it is not just a case to introduce one gene. It is a question to connect that gene to other genes in order to do useful work. One of the useful tool is called GAL4 (or UAS system). The way that scientists work with it is that to link it to another system called Genomic enhancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQZkj"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQZkj.png" alt="fMQZkj.png"></a></p>
<p>The fly at the left side has three marked chromosome. W-, + stand for white eyes and normal, respectively. When crossing that with another fly with different chromosome, a new organism is formed.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQets"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQets.png" alt="fMQets.png"></a></p>
<p>After a 15 min break, the professor showed us the tools of trade. I am familiar with those equipment for I used them everyday in lab when I studied in Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Then he showed us a video about how to use the pipette and explain the faulty operation. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQ3BF"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQ3BF.png" alt="fMQ3BF.png"></a></p>
<p>That is the end of the lecture of life science for today, and the lecture at night is called clinical skills.</p>
<p>The professor firstly introduce the definition of simulation, which is an imitation of a process or situation, a model of real-life which can be used as a safe environment to practice. Simulation modelling can be used for training or to solve real life problems in a safe and efficient manner. It also provides a useful way to analyse and learn, which can be easily understood and communicated.</p>
<p>He then emphasized the harm error of human in this area, which causes 100,000 die each year in the USA, equivalent to a full jumbo jet crashing each day over a few year. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQthR"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQthR.png" alt="fMQthR.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQU91"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQU91.png" alt="fMQU91.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQa1x"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQa1x.png" alt="fMQa1x.png"></a></p>
<p>After telling us the principles when working with simulator, the professor showed us two videos about a simulation of treating the simulator taking by students in Imperial College. The simulator are an arm and a chest to help with studying venepuncture and central venous line insertion.</p>
<p>The next part is debriefing session, and this is an unfamiliar territory for most of us. Emphasis is on both technical and non-technical issues. We are taught basis information about how we can recognize cardiac arrest and what cardiac arrest is.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQdc6"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQdc6.png" alt="fMQdc6.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQDBD"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQDBD.png" alt="fMQDBD.png"></a></p>
<p>I have always seen a type of machine that are set in airport, subway station, or other public area, but I didn’t know what it is. Today I know that they are automated defibrillator, and the professor showed us a video about how to use that by following the instruction of the machine.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQyAH"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQyAH.png" alt="fMQyAH.png"></a></p>
<p>After a 15 mins break, we start to learn CPR.</p>
<p>Here is the legal status of those who attempt CPR. Individuals who attempt to resuscitate someone in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest may be at a risk of having a claim brought against them if that person suffers harm as a result of their intervention. It is, unfortunately, extremely difficult to give any definitive advice on this subject partly due to the absence of any legal precedent and partly due to the difficulty of predicting what sort of harm might actually be suffered as a consequence of any attempted resuscitation. Broadly speaking, there are two kinds of legal duty to which citizens in the UK are subject, those imposed by Parliament which are known as statutory duties, and those imposed by the common law - the law that has been built up over the centuries as a result of decisions made by judges in court. There are no statutory duties relating to the field of resuscitation, but potential liability can arise at common law.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQc4A"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQc4A.png" alt="fMQc4A.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fMQWgP"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fMQWgP.png" alt="fMQWgP.png"></a></p>
<p>From the lecture, I knew that practical experience is as important as theory. The teamwork skill, the environment and how much you know about the emergency is much more important if you want to avoid human error and save lives.</p>

    <url>/2021/08/05/summer-school-Day4/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the first day of global summer school organized by Imperial College.</p>
<p>The first lecture is clinical skills. The professor first introduce ABCDE principle. A stands for airway, because airway obstruction is a medical emergency. Doctors should judge whether the patients can talk, are they unconscious, do they need airway protection, is there any possibility of spinal injury and whether they can remove obstruction. The slide below shows the way to protect airway.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQALbn"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fQALbn.png" alt="fQALbn.png"></a></p>
<p>B stands for breathing. Breathing could be compromised because of life threatening conditions, and doctors should look, listen and feel for the general sigh of respiratory distress. The count respiratory rate should be 12-18 per minute.</p>
<p>C stands for circulation. Doctors should look at the hands and digits and judge whether they are blue or not, and assess capillary refill time should be less tan two seconds. The count pulse rate should be in normal range, which is 60-90 beat per minute. </p>
<p>D stands for disability. The pupillary reflex, level of consciousness, temperature, blood sugar and drug chart of patients should be checked.</p>
<p>E stands for exposure. That means doctors should check whether there is rash due to allergy, Pedal Edema, or DVT(deep vein thrombosis).</p>
<p>Then the professor show us the definition of professional world related to blood pressure. It is the force of blood pushing through the arteries. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) is the maximum pressure in the aorta at the end of systole(when blood is ejected into the arteries during contraction). Diastolic blood pressure(DBP) is the minimum pressure in the aorta at the end of diastole(between heartbeats when the heat is relaxed). When blood pressure is elevated, this is “hypertension” and leads to many complications. Moreover, high blood pressure may lead to serious complication like heart attack, stroke and kidney failure, but they can be treated with life style modification and drug. </p>
<p>The professor then showed us several videos of checking the patients’ bodies. That reminds me of the dialogue between doctors and me when I went to hospital. I realize that the questions they asked me were more serious and professional than I thought after having the lecture.</p>
<p>The second lecture is investigative medicine. The professor firstly shows us some background of endocrinology. </p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQAjU0"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fQAjU0.png" alt="fQAjU0.png"></a></p>
<p>And the difference between nervous system and endocrine system.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQE9v4"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fQE9v4.png" alt="fQE9v4.png"></a></p>
<p>The structure of one specific part of brain and the organs that each of them control.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQEAV1"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fQEAV1.png" alt="fQEAV1.png"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/fQEV56"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/07/fQEV56.png" alt="fQEV56.png"></a></p>
<p>The professor them gave us five cases and asked us to enter the breakout room for discussion. The case was hard, but with the help of mentor and searching, we finally dealt with it successfully. I had never heard of some of the concepts and words in the case, and native English speaker in our academic group really helped a lot. That made me realize the importance of communication and cooperation when dealing with tasks. </p>

    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the seventh day of the summer school. We continued watching videos about identifying transgenes of drosophila melanogaster.</p>
<p>Here comes the fifth experiment, Genomic DNA Preparation.</p>
<p>For each sample, one adult fly is taken and placed in a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube(the tube is kept on ice to prevent the fly waking up).</p>
<p>To each tube ‘squishing buffer’(180ul, containing PBS + 100mm EDTA) is added.</p>
<p>To each tube RNase (20ul, 12.5ug/uL) is added.</p>
<p>Using a sterile white pestle the samples are vigorously homogenized.</p>
<p>Proteinase K(20 uL. Qiagen DNeasy Kit) is added by gently pipetting up and down before leaving for 2 min at room temperature.</p>
<p>Buffer AL(200uL, Qiagen DNeasy Kit) is added and mixed by gently pipetting up and down for 50 times using a 1000ul pipette(set to 200ul) fitted with a blue tip before heating the mixture for 10 mins(using a 56 degree centigrade heating block or water bath).</p>
<p>The mixture is cooled to room temperature and 100% ethanol(200ul) added with very gentle mixing applied using a blue tip fitted, 1000ul pipette(set to 300 ul) as before.</p>
<p>Spin columns are removed from their packaging and the entire solution from the previous step is added to each column.</p>
<p>The columns, together with the discard flow-through and collecting tube, are spun at 6000xg for 1 min in a centrifuge.</p>
<p>AW1 solution(500 ul) is added and spun at 6000xg for 1 min, flow-through in the collecting tube is discarded.</p>
<p>The column is removed and placed into a new collecting tube.</p>
<p>AW2 solution (500 ul) is added and spun at maximum speed for 3 min, the flowthrough in the collecting tube is discarded.</p>
<p>The spin column is transferred to a new 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube and AE buffer (200 ul) added before leaving at room temperature for 30 min. This time, the column and tube are spun at 6000xg for 1 min with the flow-through retained in the Eppendorf tube.</p>
<p>After searching on Google, we found that the main component of the squishing buffer is detergent.  </p>
<p>The remaining strains are Dam and Gene X. The last experiment will help identify it.</p>
<p>The tube containing the PCR master mix is vortexed and spun.</p>
<p>Using a P20 pipette master mix(19ul) is pipetted into two separate PCR tubes. The master mix contains 2 sets of primers, one for Dam, and one for gene X.</p>
<p>Using either a P2 or P10 pipette, a sample of purified DNA (1 ul), from Expt 5 above, is pipetted into the corresponding tube containing PCR reaction mixture(19 ul)</p>
<p>The PCR reaction is conducted in a thermal cycler (set as ‘Fly PCR’ in the machine) according to the automated conditions.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about professional words in this area and saw how the machine worked during the process. The academic lecture is about to the end, and hopefully I can enjoy myself in the last three days.</p>

    <title>summer school day6</title>
    <url>/2021/08/09/summer-school-day6/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Today is the sixth day of global summer school. We were told to watch videos about several experiments and identified transgenes of drosophila melanogaster. Five properties were given.</p>
<p>GFP - Expresses a protein cloned from a jellyfish, which is affected by ultraviolet light, in the fat body cells of the larvae.</p>
<p>lacZ – The lacZ gene from E.coli encodes beta-galactosidase, an enzyme that cleaves lactose into glucose and galactose.</p>
<p>Dam – Expresses the DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) protein from E.coli (when crossed to a GAL4 line) that allows researchers to study gene regulation and chromatin in Drosophila. The plasmid carrying this gene will amplify with primer pair1. It will give a 550 base pair product.</p>
<p>Dam-gene X– Expresses a protein fused to Dam(when crossed to a GAL4 line). This gene will amplify with primer pair 2. It will give a 400 base pair product.</p>
<p>Gene Y – Identified in a screen looking for thermosensitive behavioural phenotypes in drosophila. When expressed in neurons, it will exhibit a phenotype at warmer temperature(&gt;=30 degree centigrade).</p>
<p>The first experiment is lacZ activity. </p>
<p>Firstly, retrieve a wandering L3 larva of each mystery genotype and place each one in a seperate 1.5ml tube. Wash once in cold in 700 ul of cold PBS, and then remove all the PBS and dispose of it in the waste pot.</p>
<p>Secondly, pipette 300 ul of 50 mm ONPG substrate solution into each tube. While transferring for each tube, without ejecting all liquid from the tip, repeatedly jab and crush the larva with the tip. Vortex mixer can be used to help.</p>
<p>Thirdly, eject the remaining liquid from the tip and mix well by pipetting up and down.</p>
<p>After a few minutes - appearance of yellow colouration for reaction mixture containing larva expressing lacZ.</p>
<p><a href="https://imgtu.com/i/ftCssO"><img src="https://z3.ax1x.com/2021/08/10/ftCssO.png" alt="ftCssO.png"></a></p>
<p>The second experiment is LacZ Expression in Larvae.</p>
<p>A wandering L3 larva(identified in the first experiment) is retrieved and washed in cold PBS.</p>
<p>Of the given 0.2% X-gal straining solution, a droplet is pipetted onto a glass slide.</p>
<p>Larval tissues are dissected out using cold PBS(900ul) in a small petri dish (with a black Sylgard bottom) under a dissecting microscope.</p>
<p>The dissected tissues are transferred into the droplet of the X-gal staining solution on the glass slide.</p>
<p>Vaseline is applied to four points on the slide where the coverslip’s corners will be.</p>
<p>The coverslip is placed on the Vaseline, pushing down each corner individually until the coverslip is just in contact with the X-gal staining solution.</p>
<p>Staining room temperature is conducted over 20 mins.</p>
<p>As a result, a blue color is produced.</p>

<p>The third one is Fluorescence Analysis. A plate containing all strains of the larvae, a glass slide and some tweezers are taken to the fluorescence microscope. </p>
<p>On larvae from each strain is lined up on the slide before placing on the microscope to allow the different larvae to be compared side by side. </p>
<p>It is obvious to see which one is DFP positive.</p>

<p>The fourth experiment is thermosensitivity assay.</p>
<p>Vials containing adult flies are placed in a 37 degree centigrade water bath for 5 min.</p>
<p>For one vial, its contents are poured onto a dry ice-cooled platform to anaesthetise them.</p>
<p>The files are observed under the microscope to identify differences in the population.</p>
<p>Once any differences between the ones that were paralyzed and the ones that were not are identified, a brush is used to transfer one group into the original vial and the other into a new vial, thus separating them.</p>
<p>To check the hypothesis, all the flies are allowed to wake up and then both vials containing separated adult flies are placed into the 37 degree centigrade water bath, again for 5 min, nothing any dichotomy in the paralysis phenotype.</p>
<p>It is observed that one of the tube have flies that lie at the bottom, so the flies in that tube are separated according to the gender, and repeat the experiment. It turns out that only female flies are sensitive to the temperature while male are not.</p>

<p>The four experiments showed me the magic of changing variable during the process. It is the first time I fins this method efficient and time-saving.</p>

    <title>rank women by their looks</title>
    <url>/2021/08/13/rank-women-by-their-looks/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>This news on New York Times reminded me of my own experience, then I wrote down a few comments.</p>
<p>Here is the news.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/world/asia/china-artwork-ranking-women.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/21/world/asia/china-artwork-ranking-women.html</a></p>
<p>When I was seven, my best friend told me that she was thinking of getting a chemical peel. I’d never heard of the procedure before, and when she explained it to me, I thought she must be joking. She wasn’t. </p>
<p>That was 8 years ago, about the same time that Song Ta first exhibited his video “Uglier and Uglier.” As Ms. Qin and Ms. Chien explain, Song “secretly filmed thousands of female students” at a Chinese university and then ranked them according to the order suggested by the title. Although the “artwork” passed mostly unnoticed then, Song’s piece is now getting the reception it deserves: condemnation and ridicule.</p>
<p>But even though this suggests that feminists are taking on an increasingly prominent role in China, I’m here to report that the more things change, the more they stay the same. Among my female classmates, appearance anxiety is as rampant as ever, and a recent push toward more “natural” beauty standards (including a move away from plastic surgery and even make-up) has made it all the more apparent that being beautiful still represents an incalculable boon to one’s fortunes, a winning ticket in the genetic lottery. And of course, this trend applies more to women, who are used to wearing make-up, than to men, who aren’t. While I’m glad that my country is beginning to recognize that looks aren’t everything, it looks like we still have a long way to go before we reach total equality.</p>
