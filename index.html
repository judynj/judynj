            <p>The Student Union plans to organize the flea market. As a member of activity department, I took on the responsibility to make the poster for the flea market.</p>
<p>Since I have never made one myself before, I found information online to choose an app that most people recommend for making the poster, then I found one called canva, and that helps a lot.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9QfO"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9QfO.jpg" alt="Dd9QfO.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The poster and the notice should include all the details of the flea market. The details were from the PPT that the other member did, so my work was copying the details and arranged them in a more attractive way. The task sounds pretty simple, but actually it took me a lot of time. </p>
<p>For the poster, it needs to be attractive, succinct and clear, but I mixed the concept with that of a notice’s totally, that made the poster a complex one. Luckily I were aware of my mistake, then corrected it in time. The poster was soon complicated and passed the audit of the minister of activity department.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9sXj"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9sXj.jpg" alt="Dd9sXj.jpg"></a></p>
<p>A big problem came when I was making the notice. The app I chose couldn’t support to design a form. Additionally, the form was needed to include all the items that students could take to school. So I asked my minister for help. She was very enthusiastic to help me and made a form with  transparent background in the form of a picture, then I managed to uploaded it on the notice.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Dd9WNV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/25/Dd9WNV.jpg" alt="Dd9WNV.jpg"></a></p>
<p>I finished the poster and the notice before the deadline, and the minister praised me for my high efficiency. From this event, I found how greatly a right tool or app and help from others influence the result. I won the praise and trust from the minister, that is a good beginning for organizing activities in Student Union.</p>

            <p>I did a research about British educational system recently. Here is my mind map for the research.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/DYWNLV"><img src="https://s3.ax1x.com/2020/11/23/DYWNLV.png" alt="DYWNLV.png"></a></p>
<p>Here is my research.</p>
<p>Britain has a long history of educating. Its education system has undergone hundreds of years of evolution, which is quite complete and complex, and has great flexibility. Generally speaking, It is divided into three stages :Compulsory Education, Further Education, and Higher Education. The differences between Chinese and British education systems make it impossible for students of the two countries to match each other in terms of age and academic level. Therefore, when considering studying in the UK, Chinese students must fully understand the differences between the two education systems and accurately determine where their level is in the UK education system. In order to choose appropriate courses and arrange reasonable study plan according to their own characteristics.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Compulsory Education**</strong></p>
<p>●The first stage is from 5-7 years old called the kindergarten education.</p>
<p>●The second stage is from 7-11 years old called primary education.</p>
<p>●The third stage is from 11-16 years old called secondary education.</p>
<p></u><u> </p>
<p>The period of compulsory education prescribed by law is between the ages of 5 and 16. School-age children must attend school, and the State is responsible for the necessary tuition fees, books and necessary supplies.</p>
<p>The GCSE is the diploma obtained after completing the last two years of Secondary Education. The number of Chinese students studying at GCSE is small, and is only suitable for students under 16.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong> </p>
<p>Grade A* (A good result of exceptional quality)</p>
<p>Grade A  (The higher grades needed for further and higher education)</p>
<p>Grade B</p>
<p>Grade C</p>
<p>Grade D  (Regarded as average grades-a good base from which to grow)</p>
<p>Grade E </p>
<p>Grade F  (The lower, but still useful,grades of achievement )</p>
<p>Grade G</p>
<p>Ungraded  (Unfortunately, no score )</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fourth stage (further education)**</strong></p>
<p>16-18 years old is a senior middle school or college preparatory class, which is the transition period from middle school to university, also known as continuing education stage, mainly includes academic direction and career direction study. Students who complete the preparatory courses mainly take the General Certificate of Education (Advanced Level).In addition to take the GCE-A level, vocational school students take the GNVQ (General National Vocational Qualification).</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Further education**</strong></p>
<p>Further education is the most exciting part of the UK education system. It is also a crucial stage for Chinese high school students to study in the UK. Students in further education generally fall between Grade 8 and Grade 9. It is divided into two systems: the academic route and the vocational route. Both systems are equally valued in Britain.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Academic route:(A*****</strong>*-level**<strong><strong><em>\</em>)\</strong></strong></p>
<p>The full name is General Certificate of Education Advanced Level, which is an important stage of the academic course. There are more than 100 subjects in it. We tend to think of A-level as the basic course of university. Generally subjects are selected according to two principles, which are known as professional objective principle and proficiency principle.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>professional objective principle**</strong></p>
<p>The three or four A-level subjects should be chosen around the major that the student wishes to study at undergraduate Level and his/her future career goals.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>proficiency principle**</strong></p>
<p>A-level grades also determine where student gets into university, so make sure you take one or two subjects that you are good at.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>vocational route**</strong></p>
<p>GNVQ is similar to the GCSE and A-level in the academic route. Students can arrange courses according to their own needs and interest,and can even work in the process of learning.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>The elective system**</strong></p>
<p>The elective system is simple and is divided into three parts,the Foundation, the Intermidiate(is similar as 4 sessions in GCSE and generally takes one year to complete), the Advanced(is equal to 2 A-levels and generally takes two years t complete)</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>Methods of marking**</strong></p>
<p>Distinction =A/B</p>
<p>Merit=C</p>
<p>Pass=D/E</p>
<p>●*<strong>*The fifth stage**</strong> </p>
<p>It is called the college education, generally from the age of 18. It takes 3-4 years (medical for 5 years)for undergraduate study to obtain a bachelor’s degree. A master’s degree usually lasts 1-2 years,and a doctor’s degree usually lasts 3-5 years.</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>A bachelor’s degree**</strong> </p>
<p>Bachelor Degree includes BA-Bachelor of Art，BSc-Bachelor of Science，BEng-Bachelor of Engineering,LLB</p>
<p><strong><em>\</em>University of joint school**</strong></p>
<p>It is similar to the situation in China where many universities have secondary schools attached to them. Joint schools are generally close in geographical location,usually located in the same city. The purpose of establishing joint schools is to complement each other in teaching facilities and curriculum arrangement.</p>

            <p>We were asked to make a PPT to introduce British a few weeks ago. The task was having a meeting first, then writing a meeting memo before the PPT was done.</p>
<p>As the team leader, I took the responsibility to make a plan for the process. I first planned the deadline and sent it to our QQ group. The plan included everything we needed to do before the deadline.</p>

<p>In the 13th of November, we had a meeting in the hall of the international department in JinLing High School, the meeting went successfully and efficiently as we decided every part well. The PPT includes fourteen parts ,which is the name of the country, environment, climate ,natural resources, population, the symbol, administrative area, traveling, diet, history, education system, economic, transport, culture. We divided these topics into several parts, and allocated them according to their difficulty.</p>
<p>The meeting memo was done soon.</p>
<p>I learned a lot according to this opportunity to be the team leader. A team leader must plan things well, and chose the group member wisely. I knew them well and I am familiar with their qualities,then we cooperated well with each other. That leads to the success of writing the meeting memo.</p>

<p>I am sure that we can deal with the rest process together perfectly.</p>

            <p>Last week,I heard that the Student Union was looking for new members. After hearing the news, I enrolled immediately.</p>
<p>The interview came on Tuesday noon. I was really nervous when entering the room, then I stood on platform,while there was eight to nine students in front of me ,including the chairman and two vice-chairmen,and four ministers of four departments,which are known as activity department, IT department, financial department and academic department.</p>
<p>I introduced myself and told them that my experience was rich enough to be a member of activity department, because I was student in charge of propaganda work, and the work I did was associated with this department, such as decorating board and class cultural board , buying props that was needed in the sport meeting. They asked me what work could I take on if I was chosen, and I answered that I could organize some activities,since I did them so well before.</p>
<p>Soon I was informed that I was chosen in the afternoon, the ministers gave me congratulation,but at the same time she said I could talk more next time.</p>
<p>The advice made me think a lot. I am not a person that like talking much since I was very young. I was the student that spending the least time interviewed by those people because of the short speech. The phenomenon shows that I need a longer time to react after getting the question, as a result, I do not have many things to say. After thinking about it , I realize maybe the experience I have is not rich enough for me to come up with an example immediately when interviewed. However, that could be improved as time goes by.</p>

            <p>We made a lot of conversations after getting the hard topic. Finally our team gave up the experimental variable value that was talked about before because the information related to this was too hard for us to understand. Finally ,we started our experiment about the relationship between the rotate speed and the height it reached .</p>
<p>Then here came a question about the facility,the equipment we found on taobao turned out to be useless. Therefore we made one by ourselves,and the material came from daily life,for example,the engine came from an electric fan. After comparing many ways,we decided to fix the hand helicopter on the engine by hot melt glue gun. The process was amazing ,and that was my first time using such a machine.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bg4Jf0"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/11/04/Bg4Jf0.jpg" alt="Bg4Jf0.jpg"></a></p>

<p>There came another question: How can we count the times when it was rotating and how to measure the height?Our tutor recommended an app ,but it was complex to use. At the end of the club,we used the  photo function of iPhone to slow down the speed and saw whether it worked well. It came out that the result was amazing，and the times it rotated could be counted clearly.</p>

<p>From this experience,I learned a lot about how to choose a proper app to help analyze the data and how to use a machine that I had never used before. The two hours flew away quickly. In the end ,we not only recorded the experimental data,but also gained happiness and friendship between each other.</p>

            <p>After entering senior high, I moved to the house that has a skating rink nearby. Then I started to learn to skate.</p>
<p>However it turns out to be difficult. After several sessions, I found it easy to keep balance on ice ,but it was hard to skate graceful or as pretty as my coach did. In addition,sometimes I couldn’t match up my waist with legs, so the center of gravity changed a lot during coasting.</p>
<p>Luckily,my coach was pretty patient with me. He taught one method and told me about the tips over and over again,then encouraged me to practice imitating him. At present,I have already done some simple action successfully. This gives me courage to continuing skating and learning more. Practice makes perfect!</p>

<p>I made friend with a girl that graduated from the same senior high as mine,and she is now a student of an university in Canada. She was active and liked doing sports. She even set up a club called orienting when she was in high school and became the first proprietor. Because of the outbreak of corona virus,she stayed in Nanjing and worked as a dive coach. I knew her occasionally and soon became her student. She gave me advice on diving and encouraged me to pass a test to get a certification called Level 1,and that started my journey on diving.</p>
<p>Diving is a extreme sport so they are many things I should learn,like the equipment,the safety tips after getting deep in the sea.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures when I first learned how to dive into the water., the first step is great,and there is still a long way to go.</p>

<p>Besides these,I will start to join aerobics next week,and learn to play table tennis by myself with my classmates. Those kinds of sports make my spare time colorful.</p>

            <p>Recently I spent a lot of time on writing DX（known as direct examinations) for one of my clubs called Mock Trial. We will have a competition with students in Nanjing Foreign Language School.</p>
<p>The process writing DX is really exciting .We got a case summary about a girl named Jordan,who was good at running  but died because of hooking EPO under too much pressure. After her death,her parents charged a crime upon Coach Swift,who was major suspect that caused her death. Our duty was acted as different roles in these case and debated to find who was the actual murder.</p>
<p>I chose to act as Jordon’s friend,Morgan Pearce,a girl that knew the whole process. My partner I wrote DX with is my classmate Estalla. She acted as my attorney.</p>
<p>At first both of us had no idea what a DX was,so we looked through the many models the got the point,and that took us much time. Then the next problem came. Both of us were too busy to write DX together in school. The problem was dealt with quickly after a short time conversation. We came up with an appointed time to make a call on the wechat,then completed the task as soon as possible. That very evening she went online on time.</p>
<p>Since the DX has a format as a key to a question,we decided to divide our work. Estalla and I first confirmed the questions she would ask through the phone call,then she typed her them on WPS,at the same time I sent her my answer to the questions on the wechat for her to copy. The method was efficiency,and we done most of the work in one and a half hours.</p>
<p>The process of our work is like this.</p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7Z7D"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7Z7D.jpg" alt="Bp7Z7D.jpg"></a></p>
<p> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgchr.com/i/Bp7WC9"><img src="https://s1.ax1x.com/2020/10/20/Bp7WC9.jpg" alt="Bp7WC9.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Here is my feeling after finishing the task:</p>
<p>It is really my pleasure to cooperate with such a good girl. Estalla is one of the most excellent students I have ever seen before. She is easy and friendly to communicate with,and she is willing to finish the DX efficiently and perfectly as I thought we should. During our cooperating,both she and I was happy to accept suggestions from each other. This is not my first time cooperating with Estalla,and I hope that we could be partner again some day.</p>
<p>Anyway,choosing a good partner before starting a project is really important!</p>

            <p>I have prepared for the coming sports meeting since the beginning of October. I have been busy during this period of time.</p>
<p>The first one is the preparation of the dance in opening ceremony. It was really hard work to find a nice and easy-learning dance,moreover,my team had five girls,and most of them have different opinions towards it. Some thought we should choose a nice but difficult-learning dance,while others thought a simple and easy-learning one maybe better. Finally the leader chose a good-looking jazz ,then we started to learn from video on the internet,and we even hired a dancing room during the National holiday. But after a few days’ training,when it was twenty minutes before the expiration time of the dancing room ,we realized that the dance was too hard for us to learn,and the cool and fantastic style may not be suitable for us. So we decided to change with a gentle and simple one,and practiced on every PE lesson. Right till now,the process is successful as we thought.</p>
<p>Th second one is writing a profile about our group flag for the host to read .The hard point is that our group is made up of two classes ,since we international department has to be combined together as the headmaster asked. Therefor I have to mix two profiles into one and add introductions about our dance in it. That is really a great but difficult work. The deadline is closer and closer,and I am still working on it.</p>
<p>Here is my feeling about this activities.</p>
<p>Let me tell about the first activity. The result is quite good,but we still wasted our time even though correcting our mistakes promptly. However,the experience we can get is rich,as we know the decision which made first is important,if it goes wrong,that is a waste of time. So making a plan before action is the first step towards success.</p>
<p>The second thing I learn is time management. This quality is used frequently in my normal school life. Make a list of all the things I need to do, that may help or I will be busy working or staying up late before any deadline.</p>
<p>Hope I can be better step by step.</p>

My topic is about video digitizer,which is really a difficult topic for me because I knew nothing about this input device,and I couldn’t even find out its chinese meaning on the Internet!</p>
<p>So I asked my teacher for help,wanting to find what kind of device it is. He explained,but I still felt confused,so he advised me to search on Google. I thought that maybe a good idea to read its professional explanation directly instead of reading in Chinese,but later I found it difficult to enter the page because it belonged to the other country.</p>
<p>When I was thinking about what to do next,my dad came to help me. He said his colleague was on business abroad. He could ask his colleague to enter the website,searched the information and transferred it to me. After a few hours,I got the website which my father’s colleague sent to me.</p>
<p><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps1.jpg" alt="img"><img src="file:///C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\ksohtml11916\wps2.jpg" alt="img"> </p>
<p>With the information on the website,I finally understood what a video digitizer was,and completed the ppt about how it works,it’s definition,and the range of its price,as well.</p>
<p>I finally handed it in before the deadline,and introduced this kind of input device in class successfully .</p>
<p>After this experience,I learned to study by myself. It is also important to ask others to help when looking for specific information.</p>
<p>Anyway, learning by myself is really fun!</p>

<p>​                                                              参加FBLA社团的感想</p>
<p>Recently,I have been a member of a club  set in our school called FBLA. Our first task is setting a virtual company to provide goods for the coming Food Festival in January next year.</p>
<p>入学后我加入了一个叫作FBLA的社团.我们小组的第一个任务是创建一个虚拟的公司为明年一月份的校园美食节做准备.</p>
<p>The activity sounds great ,but we actually meet a lot of problems. Our group has six girls,but at first when we discussed the name of the group on wechat ,I found some of girls were too shy to come up with ideas,so they kept silence. Our group leader felt annoyed about it,so she sent some words in the wechat group,mainly to encourage the teammates to be more active and tell us their thoughts. That really worked. The goods we would produce were soon decided,so did Plan ABC. Yesterday a questionnaire about the advice the students in our school would like to give us was also done. Anyway ,the work we do together is more and more efficient.</p>
<p>这个活动听上去非常有意思，但实际上我们遇到了很多问题。我们小组的组员是六个女孩，但我发现一开始谈论小组名称的时候，一些女孩因为含羞从不提出建议。组长有点恼火，然后在微信群里发了些消息，大概意思就是想让组员们畅所欲言。这方法奏效了。我们小组很快确定了商品并制作了方案ABC。就在昨天，为了调查全校同学对方案的建议，一份电子版调查问卷新鲜出炉。我们越来越高效了。</p>
<p>Here is the feeling about the teamwork.</p>
<p>以下是我对这次活动的初步感受。</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be active and always share thoughts when solving problems in a group,or the efficiency would be particularly low when all the teammates keep silence.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>在集体活动中保持活跃，保持沉默只会让工作变得低效。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be organized and divide the duty to each of the members. If several people deal with one together,that maybe a waste of time because everyone has a different idea,and the problem cannot be solved in a short period of time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>分配任务可以让工作变得更有条理。如果一群人做同一个任务，人多口杂必然会浪费时间。</em></p>
<p>** </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Be manful as our group leader did. Because she pointed out of other’s mistakes, they can be corrected as soon as possible ,and then avoid the waste of more time.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>要学习组长的果断。她及时指出了组员的错误并让她们立刻改正，这样很好地避免了浪费更多的时间</em></p>
<p>Hope we can finish the task successfully in the next four months!</p>
<p>希望我们可以一起在接下来的四个月里顺利完成任务！</p>
